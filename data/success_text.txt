Tired hungry and in need of food
We all have our issues of this I am well aware. My story goes like this.... a few days before Christmas while I was out buying presents for my son I got a call that the house had burnt down! I took an hour long trip home to find nothing! The house and everything in it gone. My son got out with some minor burns, along with his mother. We are now stuck in a motel with nothing and its the holidays so not much help happening. The pizza is for us to share and will make an otberwise crappy end to the year feel a little more cheery. Please random acts of pizza, you're my only hope.

Central Florida - Working until Midnight and had a crappy week. Would love to surprise my husband
Basically, the gist of it is our landlord informed us over the weekend, he won't be fixing the major water leak in our house until we move, giving us little option but to try to find somewhere else to live with little to no savings to do so.  Today, the mail carrier hit my 4 year old's service dog in the face because he barked at him.  My husband is having a hard time with all of these events, and his faith in humanity is severely diminished.  He has been a stay at home dad for our little one for 4 years and is entering the work force in the new year.  I would love to be able to surprise him with a pizza and tell him a random redditor sent it, and show him that there are still decent people in the world.  We aren't going to starve without it, or anything, but I just want to see him smile.  He is not picky and any of the big 3 would be fine.  Thank you in advance for considering.

Staying in a college town over break because we are broke. We have $75 to last us a month. Depressed. Frustrated. Hungry.
We are two college students stuck in our shitty college town for break. We live in a little house with three cute cats. 

We are broke. As stated, we have about $75 to last us until the end of January. We are hungry and depressed on this NYE.

If someone would pizza us, we'd be in their debt. I have pizza'd before and will pay it forward once again.

I am happy to post pictures of our cute little guys if anyone is interested.

Supposed to get paid today but the bank is closed
I am paid on the 1st and 16th of every month. However, it seems that due to the holiday, I did not receive my deposit this morning as expected. Even if I had been paid, my debit card apparently expired today and the bank has not sent me a new one.

I was planning to grocery shop today and now I cannot. Any assistance would be appreciated.

Would like a pizza for me and my roommate tonight.
I could spin a story, we are pretty broke, but the honest truth is, I'm tired of home-cooked broke food. If someone could see their way clear to let us have a nice, no-cook dinner, I'd greatly appreciate it.

I am willing to send photos of my cats, myself and my roommate enjoying pizza, draw you a picture of your favorite anime character, or a short list of other things I have skill in. If you have a want (within reason), let me know what it is, and I'll try to make it happen. :)

Know what sounds nice? A pizza. A RANDOM pizza.
Just like it says. I would like a random pizza. From a random place. From a random person. With random toppings. Maybe other things can be random, too. Tell them to cut the pizza into random shapes! Draw a random thing on the box! It doesn't even have to be a pizza. Wings and sandwiches and salads are also acceptable. Ever wanted to order someone pizza wings? I'm your guy. I don't have a sob story, I'm just hungry and feel like a random pizza would be nice at work. Also, it's snowing and I'm lazy.  

ONLY ONE REQUEST: No anchovies or jalapenos, if possible. Unless you want to. But I'd prefer you didn't want to.

Got some crappy news this week.
Hey pizza lovers. I found out this week that the girl I've been spending a lot of time and money on, who was supposed to move 1000 miles across the country for me, has been sleeping with a friend of mine from home. I don't NEED a pizza really, but it would help fill this little hole for now. I'm semi active here and will return the favor if someone takes care of me.

Marine just returning from leave; getting home for Christmas drained my bank account
Hi, RAOP! Happy New Year's (even if it's a little late). I just returned from home, and in the process of getting there and back, my bank account went into the red. It's the last day of our leave block, and I'd appreciate a pizza to see it off with a bang.

My wife hasn't been able to eat cheese for almost a year. Now she can and we were going to celebrate with a pizza feast - but money's too tight this month. I'd love to surprise her if anyone wants to help.
For medical reasons my wife hasn't been able to have any dairy for almost a year.  We've been planning to have a nice pizza and movie night once the issue was past (which it now has) but unfortunately post-holidays money is way too tight to do it until at least February.  I'd appreciate any help in pulling out a surprise and will certainly pay it forward once money's back to normal.  Thanks regardless!

Edit to add: I hope this doesn't make me seem ungrateful or picky, but I am a bit uncomfortable giving out my street address and would prefer an email ecard. The thought is appreciated regardless though.

So bad news is I need food tonight. Good news is I get paid Monday, so I can buy groceries for the family. We've been tight financially for a couple of months and my grandfathers surgery was the straw that broke the camels back. Would anyone be willing to help me out with some pizza?

Savannah, GA, Paycheck comes in on Thursday!


I just graduated from grad school in December and started my career this past week, but my first paycheck won't come in until Thursday at the earliest (waiting on paperwork from my school to get to my employer). My husband and I have been living off our savings and my financial aid from school for the past five months, but that's all dried up now. 

If you would be so kind to buy us a pizza, that would be amazing! We're doing our best until Thursday, but that low bank account and empty fridge are making it real hard.

Broke and bummed out, hoping a pizza will make me feel better

Hi,

To make a long story short my student loan company withdrew the wrong amount of money for my payments and now I have a negative account balance. I get paid this coming Friday but I don't really have a lot to eat until then. I'm willing to show proof if you need it.

I do have a 14 day X-Box Live Gold trial I'm willing to trade for the pizza. I live in Waterloo, IA so we have Domino's,  Pizza Hut, and Papa John's around here.

Thanks!

Things are looking like they finally might turn around for my wife and me, but
[oops i didnt finish the title lol]...a pizza would really help us in the here and now.

My wife and I moved halfway across the country a couple months ago to pursue her dream and get her away from a place we really couldn't be living in anymore. We're young and weren't making much money before, but we had saved up enough to live for a while.

Well her sure-thing job she was coming into has been moving at a snail's pace in the hiring process and it's getting really frustrating. I've been going through job rejections too, but it finally looks like I'll be getting a great job offer and starting this week! We're so relieved, and it couldn't be happening at a more necessary time, as right now we are basically flat broke. I mean *broke* broke. I'll be using the last of our money to take the bus to work, and calling up a family member to loan us some money until next month when I'll be able to pay them back.

Luckily we still have a big bag of rice, a jar of pasta sauce and plenty of pasta, some frozen chicken, frozen veggies. Variations of pasta and fried rice will get us by, but a pizza would be really appreciated. We're located in Orange, Ca and according to google maps it looks like there's a pizza hut and a domino's down the street from us.


Edit2: we're gonna go make some dinner now so no pizza tonight. Thanks anyway though guys! This is a pretty cool little community
edit: hey! I can also do a digital drawing for you as "payment". I know it's not much but they've been appreciated by some peeps at /r/worldbuilding. I'm sure you can think of some creative idea you want a visual realization of.

New Teacher, no money, and cannot sub anywhere today because all schools closed.
Hello, I am a 24 year old recent graduate of a University in Wisconsin. I haven't had a chance to work much because no one is hiring in the middle of the school year, and I can't even substitute today to make money because of the holiday. I just found out about this subreddit today and am not sure how this works, but I certainly don't feel comfortable begging. But if someone out there reading this could help me out it would make my day! Willing to trade more pictures of my kitty and/or League of Legends tips from a diamond player in return :). http://imgur.com/rmYogS0 http://imgur.com/s7euFb8 Also I am not sure if this will help, but I have also used the verification system, to reassure you I am not a scammer. Just me and my gf trying to eat something that isn't Ramen.

Finally coming to an end on my savings that's been getting me by and I'm pretty damn low on food and a pizza sounds really good right about now with how much shit i've been thrown with.  I did get a job but I start on the 2nd of Feb.  I'll be back to return the RAOP then :)

Hey guys, what can i do for a pizza?
It's my day off, been a crazy week or two, some pizza would be insane. 

So what can i do for you guys for some tmnt grub? I'm not much of an artist, but i enjoy drawing pathfinder stuff, i can write a mean haiku, or i can add a thank you to my next Youtube video (might be a while, it's a WIP)

If not, It's cool, I'm not starving or anything, it'd just be a way legit day off.

Edit - I'm in Utah, have the big 3 near me, as well as some local stuff.

Small pizza for a guy sleeping out of his car?
Hey guys!  Just an unemployed simpleton here who could use a pizza to get through tonight.  I often don't get to buy ready-made warm foods with my food stamps and have no where to cook/store food.  The only cash I have is from trying to sell my stuff from my storage - to be used just for gas and priority bills.

My zip code is 33611 and there's a Papa Johns / Domino's around the corner from me.  Obviously, I don't have a physical location where you could have the pizza delivered to me, so I can only carry out.  

Thanks guys!

EA/Origin account hacks got to me, and I'm pretty broke
Hey guys,

Just wanting some pizza, or something to eat, I'm fairly broke because of the Origin/EA Account hacks. $250 of purchases were made on my account, and though I got a refund the damage was done as bills were paid. Before the money returned to my account all my bills went through and over drafted my account. I've got about $5.00 to last me until Thursday. Some dominos would help out considerably as I've depleted my Ramen, and Pot Pies yesterday.

Ex-Journalist between jobs and looking to get back in college.

Life has been interesting Reddit.

I was the digital editor for my local newspaper. I got paid to read stories, write tweets &amp; facebook posts and manage their website. It was a pretty sweet gig, especially considering I don't have a degree in journalism or communications. Almost too good to be true. The corporation that owned my paper decided to do a company-wide 'reinvention.' This reinvention involved a 15% workforce reduction.

I lost my job mid-November.

It was bittersweet really. One. I was a goddamn journalist. There wasn't a day where it didn't feel like the Sword of Damocles was hanging over our heads. Two. They told us it was coming months ago, as if to make us cutthroat animals willing to kill for our jobs. I'm happy to say we didn't stoop to their level.

December was a rollercoaster. I got a job at a local indie bookstore on campus, which is pretty sweet. Three of the seven employees went home for the holidays so they desperately needed someone to fill the void. It was minimum wage but I got paid to clean books and talk to people about books, which I loved doing. I also got connections with the college. I looked into auditing a class on fiction. Got turned down but offered a chance to audit a graduate level course on Young Adult Literature. Pretty awesome since I'm sitting on a YA manuscript I am trying to polish.

It was a hassle (but cost nothing) to audit a class. I signed up as a non-degree student. I figured "What the hell. I'll look into what it takes to actually get back into school." I kind of screwed the pooch the first time I went to school and I'm sitting on a student loan in default. It was pretty easy to piece together a battle plan to go back by next year though. I'm pretty stoked.

Then January came and those three other employees returned. I went from getting about 30 hours a week (enough for my state to say "Hahaha... You don't need unemployment anymore.") to one day a week. It stings a little. I am wondering how I am going to pay rent and buy the rest of the books for my YA LIT class I volunteered to take. I recently applied at one of the campus bars to be a bouncer, something I'm not entirely sure I am suited to do.

To be honest though, I am the happiest I've been in awhile. I've sat around for five years living a comfortable but meaningless life. I've made more progress in a year (roughly when I got the job at my paper) than I have in those five. I got a job I've always dreamed of having, wrote a book (note writing a book and editing a book to be remotely readable are two very different things) and I am now closer than I have been to going to the College of my dreams. I'm on top of the world.

I just need to figure out how to financially stay there.

But really, I'm here because I was on the shitter, googled 'free pizza' and found an article that led me to you guys. Plus my mother is sick of her twenty eight year old son mooching meals off her.

TL;DR: Ex-journalist/writer/soon-to-be-college-student who has hit a rough spot but is feeling pretty good wants free pizza because he is broke as shit.

Going broke towards the end of the month sucks
Hey guys! I've posted before with no luck but I didn't really need the pizza it would have been a satisfying dinner. 

Now I'm coming back and hoping to impress my mom and siblings on how I managed to get dinner over the internet. 

Income taxes haven't been filled yet and my mom is struggling at the moment. 

I have a papa Johns, pizza hut, and dominoes near me.  NYC based 

If anyone could help out me and my family I'd be really appreciative.

I'm a hungry gal, and my mother (no joke) just messed up her knee in kick boxing. I'd love to bring home a pizza for her tonight, but I'm out of funds. I have pizza'ed often on this sub (although, I'm not sure if I ever requested flair...) Anyway! [A quick doodle to get things started, eh? ](http://imgur.com/bTvoxGP)

Unexpectedly watching a house full of kids

It would be great to get a pizza for them. All together there's 6 kids, ages 2-6. I have such an intense migraine right now and the thought of cooking is unbearable. If someone is able to help out, I'll pay it forward on pay day. 

Located in Arizona. Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's are all options here.

My dog is sick, my wife is pregnant taking care of my dog, and I am out of town.
My dog is seriously sick/injured right now, and my pregnant wife is home alone working on taking care of him. I am out of the state for work and cannot help her, so she is doing it all alone. We have spent a lot of money figuring out what is wrong with my dog, and you can read below if interested. I would like to get my wife a surprise pizza, so she can just relax and have a meal without having to worry about anything - I would buy one for her, but with all of the vet bills I simply cannot afford to. Will someone please help me? This pizza isn't even for me.

Bored photography student with a day off, looking to make a trade.
I would be more than happy to photograph something around/near my house for some pie.I'm in MN, it's sunny, and low 20's.I also have an orange cat and a house full of random stuff.
Because a pizza trade is involved, see it as a small gig for our enjoyment (and my hunger).

Give me an idea of something you'd like photographed, I'll do a quick edit, and send it your way! No watermark and I give permission to do what you'd like with it.

Please help feed my friend's 3 year old.
My friend and his family, has been screwed by his roommate. They were paying half of all the bills for the last few month's, and the roommate was pocketing the money, and not paying the bill's. He was able to get the bill's paid, to at least keep them on but was unable to fill his fridge. He doesn't get paid again until the 30th and is in a tight spot. Normally I would look out for him, but I don't have the cash right this minute. If someone would help him out, it would be greatly appreciated, he has a 3 year old son (my godson), whom he is trying to keep fed.

It's my 26th birthday. I only have a couple bucks to my name, and would love some dinner :)
Happy January 22nd everyone! One of my favorite days of the year :)  

This year, we moved to a new state, and my SO has still not found work. We have been struggling to get by lately, unfortunately.  We don't have anything beside spaghetti we have had the last two nights in our fridge.  I would be the happiest birthday girl alive if I had some pizza for dinner :) I feel bad even asking... but I love to pay it forward, so as soon as I can, like when my taxes come through, I really want to also give some pizzas to my fellow redditors :)

Thanks for being part of this sub, regardless. It always makes my heart feel warm when I see people giving and receiving here!

My mom doesn't get payed until tomorrow and is worried about food tonight. I'd like to give her one less thing to worry about
A copay to go to the doctor today and get prescriptions has taken our food budget tonight. I'd really appreciate a pie or two to get us to Saturday night when funds will be available. We like Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, and any other big chain pizza places if anyone has a giftcard :) Will also share a picture of me and my beautiful mom to whover gives :)

Just accepted an employment offer!! Still broke, help me celebrate by eating not-ramen.
I'll be giving one pizza per week once I start getting paychecks. Unemployed for almost 3 months. Food is running really low around here.

Thanks, guys.

My boyfriend is in the hospital, I'm home alone, scared, sad, and hungry.
I could really use a pizza guys.  I'm just sitting home alone (in mid-Michigan), waiting for news, any news.  My boyfriend had to have a testicle removed a few months ago due to testicular torsion, and luckily there were no complications.  Last night he noticed a lump around that area after experiencing quite a bit of pain, and he's been in the hospital for a few hours now with no news, and I have no idea when I'll hear from or see him again.  He could be in surgery again for all I know.  I'm scared, and I'm sad, and feel so alone right now, and I think a pizza could really cheer me up. Thank you so much.

I am at work on a Friday. We are all college students, trying to get over the fatigue of the first week of school. After tuition, books, fees, and parking passes, we have no money left. Pizza would be awesome!
As I said, we're a bunch of tired and broke college students. Some of you may know our struggle. Never tried this out. Might be an awesome secret gift for my coworkers. We're from Carson, CA. :)

Early birthday pizza? Really, just random pizza
My birthday is in about a week! But I don't know if it's possible to prove so I'll stick with the idea of random and just throw this out there and see what happens. 

Even if something doesn't come of this, I'm glad I found this sub! The idea is great :) Looking forward to contributing my share as soon as I can afford it!

Can't afford my medication, withdrawaling, using a ghetto-rigged ostomy bag and I'm hungry.
I posted this just a few minutes ago and deleted it.  I forgot to add [REQUEST] to the title and I figured that was more important than not deleting, since I'm assuming the no-deletion rule is there to prevent scamming and such.  If I was wrong about that please excuse me.

My girlfriend and I have lived together for almost 10 years (11 year anniversary will be the 28th). About 7 years ago, I got very sick and ended up having to get a permanent ileostomy (ostomy bag, if you don't know what it is and you're eating, don't look it up.)

I'm still waiting on disability payments to come through. My girlfriend got laid off recently, and we're now on the second week of not having any money left.

I can't afford the ostomy bags, so I'm using a plastic grocery bag duct-taped to my stomach.

I'm on methadone, because I was on pain medication for a long time and it's very hard to go off of, and the methadone helps with what little pain I have left on top of preventing opiate withdrawals. I can't afford it, and I'm very sick because of it.

We're now officially out of food, except one can of Homestyle Chicken Noodle Soup, two packets of kool-aid and a box of angelhair pasta.

After remembering about hearing about this sub, I figure the food is the only thing I might be able to do something about.

Apologies for the sob story, but I guess I kinda assumed that people like to hear about all the crap people have to go through when they come here.

SO and I are broke but just landed job interviews. We would love to eat/celebrate!
First off, I'm a dipshit and delete accounts every so once and a while, so this is a throwaway account that I managed to get the appropriate karma on. My account is u/kroka4loka and it is very much active and you're welcome to go through my history on it. My girlfriend and I both finally landed jobs/interviews but are still broke and ramen sounds terrible. I will be more than happy to pay someone back for a pizza once I get paid in exchange for a pizza today.

San Diego, CA. Law homework is slowing killing my soul and my spirits.
So I wish I had a sob story that would make me more likely to get pizza. The truth is though that I am just a broke college student suffering at the hands of homework and convoluted wording. I should be able to pizza forward within a few weeks, but until then I wish I had something delicious and not self-made. 

To be clear, I have food and I am not going to starve. It's just all in the 20-45 minutes to prepare range and I should be studying for my final in 2 days, but I still have an essay and 27 case briefs to do until I can actually go over the study guide.

Thanks for looking, thanks for reading, and I wish all of you a great day. See you in the funny papers!

Pizza for Middle School youth in Wilmington, DE
I work for a non-profit and we are currently making popcorn for a fundraiser for our spring break trip to Chicago! 

My Director and I work with these middle schoolers in an after school program, and we really care about them a lot. Lunchtime is coming up and were asking our kids not to eat all the popcorn (lol!). Figured I would reach out here. Kids are coming and leaving to help but will probably have about 10 hungry bodies in the room at some point, so 3 or 4 pizzas would be awesome!

[Here's some proof :)](http://imgur.com/I8EPoyd) One of my kids and my username.

Just another broke and hungry reddior. [US]
Hey guys. I have never requested anything of reddit before, so I feel a bit awkward doing this. :p

I don't know what to say, honestly. I'm sitting at home trying to find the A/C adapter for my 3DS XL just so I can trade it in for $65 right now for food. I haven't eaten all day, and haven't been making a lot of hours at work so I only have $1 to my name right now. I can't seem to find the A/C adapter and kinda wanna cry because now I won't be able to eat until tomorrow. That's if I even do well enough in tips.

Anyway, sorry for the pity story. I'm willing to chat with anyone so they can tell if I'm honest or whatever. I also have a FB page I'm willing to share with someone who honestly wants to help out. Same with my location info and such. I'm in the US.

It doesn't even have to be delivery. I'm able to pick it up, since that's usually cheaper. I have to pick my fiance up from work in an hour (he's just as broke as I am..) so I'd be out and about anyway. I'm not looking for much. Maybe just a large 1-2 topping. Pizza Hut in my area has them for $7.99 for carry out.

Thanks in advance!


**Edit: Also, I know some of you guys hate the sob stories. I'm not trying to guilt anyone into picking me for a pizza. I'm just being honest. I'd feel bad for lying or not giving you guys a reason for making a request. I'm just sitting here thinking of various ways to get some food and this sub came to mind. I'm really sorry if anyone gets annoyed by my post. If I end up finding another way for some cheap pizza, Ill make another edit.

Want to prove my family and friends wrong
I'm trying to prove to them that Reddit is a friendly and nice community to visit. When they see me on Reddit, they may laugh or insult me because I'm in this community. The heard from their friend the dark and bad side of Reddit.

That is why I joined the Reddit exchange, because I know that there are the good people willing to give gifts to each other, knowing that they may not get anything in return.

Oregon USA Broke a few days before payday, just got home from work, pizza would be radical.
Not much of a sob story, or a story at all. I get paid on thursday, and the groceries didn't quite last as long as usual. I just got home from work (I'm graveyard) and I'm looking at unsweetened malt-o-meal and a jar of chunky peanut butter. Pizza sounds better. I mean it always does, pretty much regardless of the circumstances, but right now it sounds especially nice.

I'd absolutely return the favor, if that's acceptable etiquette here. The pizza is a circle because we are all equal before it. No dick moves.

Broke, Birthday is Tuesday. Buy me and my kid a pizza? (Portland, Oregon)
Hey folks, so I turn 28 on Tuesday. I'm a single dad and I have an awesome 11 year old kid.
I'd love to do something to celebrate, but I'm broke. 
(For the curious, my phone broke and I was forced to buy a whole new one. These stupid things are EXPENSIVE.)

Is anyone willing to buy me and my kid a pizza?

Some guy got shot last night, I'll probably be sleeping in my car next week and need a pizza.
So, I am disabled and out of work. I'm stuck living in this shithole extended stay hotel (some guy got shot in the room upstairs last night)and I have no food and i can't even pay for this room until i get my check next week. I could use a pizza since I haven't eaten anything in a day and a half. I can pay this forward next week its just that life really sucks right now.

Praying for Pizza.
So my sister and I are sitting here with 2 Mormon Missionaries. We got on the subject of the internet and Reddit and I said something about Random Acts of Pizza.
They do not believe me. 
As per the missionary agreement thing they take they cannot use technology and do not believe that people on the internet are nice enough to randomly donate pizza to another random person.
So, Reddit. Can we prove a few Elders wrong here?
Thanks in advance!

hunger has taken over my pride.Can't make it to the food bank until tomorrow.
Hi.I am disabled and on a very fixed income.Normally I am able to make ends meet through out the month.I have been eating rice for the last several days,and due to the fact that I am insulin dependent diabetic,it is catching up with me.I have had an unforseen bill this month (can provide more specifics if need be).I would just like to have some real food in my belly for the evening.There is a small foodbank that is open close by tomorrow from 4-6 that I will go to,that will help me make it until my SSDI check arrives on the 2nd.I really have no family to turn to help for,at least anyone close by with any means to help.

I have been a redditor for over a year and I have never asked for any help here what so ever.Please,it would be nice to stop my stomach from growling.

Thank you for your time.

It's my birthday and I'm piss poor and alone today. Please could someone feed me? I'm from the UK.
Hey. So yeah I'm 27 today. I'm sat at home all alone with no food because I'm off work sick and still no pay from work &gt;.&gt;. If someone is reading this who is a mod, I've given two ecards to people who openly thanked me, but it still shows that I've only ever taken one pizza from someone )the got pizza'd tag). I know this isn't about taking credit for giving someone pizza, but I don't want to look like I'm someone who just takes pizza and doesn't give back. Cheers.

Still here in the hospital with our daughter. We have 2 cans of Chef Boyardee, 2 servings of cereal, and 2 cups of ramen left. Can anyone help please?
It's 7:15 AM.  (I realize its early, but we would love to be able to order something for lunch.) We've been here since Thursday morning.  We've had canned food and dehydrated food each day.  My husband and I are both here with our daughter.  They're testing her for celiac, chrones, immunoglobulin deficiency, enzyme disorders, and FPIES.  We are going to be here for a while.  We have $50 left on the food stamp card, but I have no way to get to the grocery store when my husband leaves for work.  They have restricted the use of the refrigerator/freezer to patient use and parents single meals only, meaning that if I wanted to get 4 frozen food dinners for 2 meals for 2 people, I'd have to make 2 seperate trips.  We cannot use the fridge for drinks unless it is for use because of an allergy issue.  The grocery store my husband has been going to does not have a deli with fresh food like fried chicken or subs.

Papa Johns is the only chain pizza that will deliver to the hospital.  

Can anyone please help us with a gift card?


Thanks everyone.

Pregnancy sucks when you're in a bit of a pickle!
Preggers proof! http://imgur.com/zcvWMjf I originally joined this sub because I wanted to be able to buy pizza for others, but in a turn of events, on New Years Eve, my fiance got laid off from work. He just got hired on for a new job, &amp; I have been working,only part time because I am pregnant, but suffer from Hyperemesis gravidarum (which is extreme nausea, vomiting- I can't keep food or water down without zofran. Trust me, if I wasn't sick so much, I would LOVEEE to work full time) Now because I have only been working part time, we have essentially sold everything we can to pay for our bills, but now are short on rent and are down to the bare minimum as far as food goes. We have a few cans of soup, some rice, some leftover chicken I made in the crockpot about a week ago, and this has to last us another week and a half. It would mean a lot to my fiance and I if we can eat something different tonight since it is going to be a while before we can get legitimate groceries. I don't have much to offer back except my gratitude, and the promise that when his paychecks are coming in, I return the offer to someone else in desperate need! ♡ I finish work at 9pm tonight &amp; it would be amazing to be able to order something when I get home. Thanks in advanced &lt;3 And I hope everyone is having a wonderful Tuesday (:

First post, have been unemployed for over a month and had limited food.
Hey there RAOP. This is my first experience here. I've thankfully never been in this kind of situation before, but I've been unemployed for over a month. I've been actively looking for a job and have had several interviews this week, so I'm hoping to hear something back soon. I've been saving all of my money to pay my rent/bills at the beginning of the month so I haven't bought much food lately. I ate toast last night for dinner and toast this morning for breakfast. A pizza would last me for both lunch and dinner and would be a nice change. Thank you in advance.

Edit; I'm in Baltimore, Maryland. I'm also very happy to return the favor once I secure a job.

Willing to paint/draw anything in exchange for pizza. Will take requests and even frame and ship it if possible. I'm just a bored and hungry person. No sob story really.

[WI, USA] Wallet stolen. Lost everything.
My wallet was misplaced last night, me being the optimist that I am assumed it would turn up tomorrow or the next day... just checked my prepaid work debit card and all of the money on it was gone. I've contacted the bank about it but there's no way of getting it back immediately, (lady at the bank said it'll take about 2 weeks to get it all back) so I'm broke and super hungry. 

To top it all off, I'm fortunate enough to have to go to the DMV during my normal work schedule to hopefully get a new drivers license which will also cost me $36 bucks that i don't have. 

A pizza would be so amazingly helpful. 

Willing to pay it back with a pizza giveaway on February 6th if anyone wants to help out today..

Thanks everyone.

Always wanted to use my request as an emergency and give twice before requesting but that doesn't seem to be the case. FL.
I had made plans with two friends to come over and we can hang and watch movies on the laptop if they bring half the money it would take to order pizza for the night. About 12 hours later, they both bailed. I've learned that I have really *really* bad friends.. a pie would be nice, not really looking for money for much else. If I ordered breadsticks or wings solely with my money, I'll be hungry (and broke) by late night. I have fast metabolism and the pie will be my midnight snack and breakfast as well. Thank you for all who read this!

My wife wants a divorce, I don't have any mental stability and my son is hungry. All of our bills are past due and we may not even make the rent.
We are on food stamps and they were cut in half because of some bull shit paper work. I can barely muster the strength to take care of my son. I'm so unhappy and I'm just trying to be a good father but I feel like I can't be one on my own. I haven't been able to eat and now that I finally feel like I'm going to pass out I need to. I don't know where to turn or what to do. I don't expect to actually get any pizza out of you guys but it sure would be nice to not have to cook when I feel this faint. Thanks for reading my story. Update: Managed to get together enough strength to make some ramen for us but this still all really sucks. Update 2: We are short $125 on the rent but the landlord agreed to work with us.

First time doing this but here goes:

I work in a small Mom/Pop type UPS store in South Jersey (think Mailboxes Etc) and the other two employees who are supposed to work today also called out "sick" so I can't leave to go get food, ugh! Could some kind redditor hook a hard-working starving guy up? Papa Johns will do just fine!

Lunch for me and my little family
Hello everyone. I'm currently an unemployed mom to two little kids and a 1 year old baby. Im going through some tough times right now because their father just lost his job so he is unable to give me money. My food benefits do not kick in until next week (the 11th) so I've been trying to create small meals out of basic things like ramen noodles, hotdogs, or Mac and cheese. My kids don't complain because they are wonderful kids but it really hurts me inside because I wish I can give them more. My oldest is in second grade and coming home in a few hours and I would love to surprise him and his siblings with amazingly delicious hot pizza which we have not had for a months. Any kindness, even in thoughts, would be appreciated. I promise to give back when I'm able to, which hopefully will be very soon. Thanks in advance. We are in Lynn, MA.

It's #NationalPizzaDay , why not try my luck?
Hello fellow RAoPers, first time poster here so please tell me if I did something wrong :) i think i got everything down from the sidebar. Well I was on twitter a few minutes ago and saw a trending tag you guys might like (https://twitter.com/hashtag/NATIONALPIZZADAY?src=tren) so i figured maybe someone would be kind enough to brighten my day. I'd really appreciate it because I got word a few minutes ago that one of my friends was arrested last night, and i cant help them right now for a myriad of reasons, mainly because im a broke college freshman, and because they live in another state. Thanks for reading, and even if I dont get a pie i hope the title raises awareness for Natl. Pizza Day in this forum, and someone who is on the fence about offering today, starts feeling generous.

tried this, figure now is a pretty good time.
I'll try to sum this up as best as I can.
So I figured a little celebratory pizza would be nice. I had my first ultrasound today (which was awesome), got a call confirming a job with great hours and benefits (which is more awesome), but don't exactly have money for pizza (which is significantly less awesome). And husband went out of town so I'm on my own tonight and I'm exhausted from cleaning the apartment. 
If someone were to pizza me I'd return the favor when I get my first paycheck in two weeks.
(I'm near all major pizza chains in WA)

I'm cascading blood and need a biting stick to deal with the pain. And it will happen again next month, and every month after that for 3 decades. Pizza is my only hope.
Over the counter painkillers don't work. I tried hormonal birth control, but it kills my sex drive during the rest of the month. I'm miserable and twisted in my sheets unable to get comfy. The heating pad is woefully underwhelming. A pizza would help.

Need some kind of meal for tonight with family.
So currently in my household we have nothing to eat. We have a 2 liter bottle of coca cola, and a jar of peanut butter. That's it, no bread even. 

So yeah. 

I hate having to go on here to get help, but it's kind of a last resort ya know? When I've been in similar situations before I've posted on here before but I'd delete the post a few mins or even seconds after posting, it's just scary to me. But right now I need  to suck it and try anywhere I can to get some kind of food for tonight.

In case you're wondering, "Why is this idiot not going to churches and food banks but going on the internet asking for pizza off strangers?!", we've already called churches and food banks and everyone's turned us down for going in because they either didn't have enough food or aren't open today. Which sucks. 

So, If anyone can help out with some food for my mom, dad, and I, we'll be incredibly thankful. Many thanks.

Got laid off from my shitty job! Would like some pizza to celebrate the start of my new financially-insecure job search. Promise to pay it forward, too!
Hey guys. I just got my ass laid-off from my shitty retail job, and I don't get my last pay for another week. I've been living off ramen noodles, peanut butter and grilled cheese for weeks 'cause they cut my hours so much.

If someone could get a pizza or two for my girlfriend and I, I would be more grateful than words could ever hope to express. I'll also pay it forward in a month or two once I'm financially secure. You have my word. You don't have to believe me though, I'm just some random guy on the internets. 

tl;dr got laid off, not starving but sick of shitty food. gf is too. pizza pls? will pay forward &lt;3

No money until tomorrow, will repay!

 Our car has decided to run down without any reason, we can't afford a mechanic until our income tax. All we've had this week is cheeseburgers, sandwiches and spaghetti. We're all out of food now.

We do have canned fruits and vegetables, but that isn't working for my three year old. We only need food for tonight, we get paid tomorrow and I can repay the favor!

The nearest delivery place would be Dominos.

Suddenly lost my dad yesterday, not feeling up to anything. Have family to feed
I lost my dad very suddenly yesterday. I got there just in time before he passed (he passed within an hour of my arrival). I have been grieving and not feeling up to the challenge of cooking for my family. It's Valentine's Day and my husband loves pizza. If someone could pif some pizza for my husband and kids to eat tonight I would appreciate it tremendously. Located in Milton, FL

My Girlfriend of 3 years dumped me today, and now im feeling like crap.
My Girlfriend just dumped me today after being together for 3 years. She said she didn't feel anything towards me anymore and that she didn't want to get trapped into something that she would regret later on. So here I am, alone, depressed, and hungry. If anyone on here has the spare cash to help me out I would be so grateful.

Got stood up on a Valentine's Day date. A pizza would be nice.
Tonight was supposed to be the first time I haven't spend Valentine's Day alone in almost five years. Got something set up, made reservations at a restaurant that was frankly way too expensive, and got stood up. It'd be cool if someone could help me drown my sorrows with pizza.

Just a poor HS teacher looking for some pizza to break the rice cycle.
Low on money until next check and all I really have right now is a ton of rice. Would love a pizza to change things up. 87106

I'm a 23 year old single mother working on my Masters degree. Would love to treat my kid to his favorite pizza place
So, I don't have a real sob story. I worked my way through college to get my bachelors, and I had to scrub more than a few floors in order to pay my tuition off, as I graduated. Now I'm back in school for my masters (Civil Engineering), with a 5-year old little man that has a sweet tooth, and a love for the chocolate lava cakes that dominos makes.   

Since I'm still in school I cant work fulltime, and I don't always have the money to go out and get pizza and lava-monstrosities for my little guy. 

*If you are feeling generous, we'd both appreciate it.*  

[Here's me and my little guy](http://imgur.com/evfIRTT,3mfRGVC#0) if you're wondering. Yes, he is as awesome as he looks :)

Broke student, have only eaten brown rice for the past 3 days
~~I'm a couple weeks from starting a new job but until then my cupboard is populated solely with a 10lb bag of brown rice and tea and my bank account is in the red. Any assistance would be appreciated. I intend to give back to this subreddit with my first paycheck as thanks, you folks are awesome. I am in San Diego, CA if that helps any. Thank you.~~

Two Kids and a teething baby.
I have recently been entrusted with two children, as well as my own who is currenly cutting four teeth and screams like he's dying if I put him down. (seriously, my neighbors called the cops thinking I was killing him, when really cutting teeth just hurts a lot.) Well, I can't seem to put him down without him freaking out and screaming to the point of the neighbors being concerned, and I have two starving 4 and 8 year olds who are begging me for pizza, but payday isn't until Thursday and I just have kraft dinner cups in my cupboard. A pizza or two would be amazing.

Sad teething baby (whose finally sleeping after being up all night and half the day, yay!)- http://i.imgur.com/kMSRSyI.jpg

Something other then Honey Buns.
I haven't been too work since Valentines day. I tried to call of then with the plague but, "calling off on a holiday could mean immediate termination". So I toughed it out, went to work, and then couldn't leave bed for two days... I don't know if anyone else works in a restaurant but with the wages they pay me I can barely afford to buy groceries, so I eat half of my meals at work. I went to work today, after literally two days eating 2 for $1 honey buns from the corner store, and they sent me home for being "too congested too work with food". That's three days eating honey bun specials, and three days lost pay. I need a bottle of NyQuil, I need insurance, I need a pick me up in the form of pizza. Otherwise it's time to spend my last two dollars on another 3 course honey bun special. First I'll eat the glazed one to cleanse my palette. Followed by the two iced buns as a main course. Then chocolate frosted, of course, for desert. If I'd known about this sooner, I would have been buying already. I'm in Flint.

EDIT: Found this sub by searching google for "free pizza". You guys have got some attention.

I am very reluctant to reach out to people for help, but I don't know where else to go.
Hi guys! I'm a single, broke special ed resource room substitute (USA, Oregon) and I get paid monthly; hours have been tight and my pantry is literally empty (except for sugar and non-dairy creamer!). I don't get paid until the 26th, and I'm not eligible for a cash advance.

It feels very foreign to me to reach out to anyone (especially a stranger) for something as necessary as food. As a grown man I get a twinge in my stomach when I realize that I'm asking someone for help to feed me. I know in my heart of hearts that I have a roof over my head and power in my room and internet in the air (thank god for roommates and a flat rent fee) and I can't help but think that a pizza could go to 100 other people more needy than myself and that every word I type is an invitation to some pity party... Then I remember that I can't live off of mustard and jelly, try as I might. 

Thanks to anyone reading this, I hope you have a great night.

Babysitting my brother today in a house with no food. Would like to get a pizza since I was left with no money to feed him.

My Dad told me to babysit my 7 year old brother. Dad goes to the grocery and buys bread and milk, and forgets (after I reminded him 10 times) that we have nothing to eat the bread and milk with. I made him 4 pieces of bread and butter for breakfast. It would be nice to get a pizza that will last us the day. I hate how shitty he is to him, and how broke I am. It sucks waiting on a lousy paycheck.

Broke with no lunch. Please help. (US)
I've already been pizza'd once before. If you think I am undeserving of more charity you are well within your rights. Bit of an update- I found a job but all my money has been going to my past due bills in an attempt to keep my credit from burning to cinders.

 Basically the way things are now, lunch is this old unwrapped piece of gum I found in my jacket pocket.

Broke and Pregnant Student Hoping For a Bite
No money at the moment and even if I did have enough for a just a 5 dollar Little Caesar's the bus doesn't run by my house on Saturdays ): I've been having pizza cravings all day and was trying to get the thought of a slice out of my mind which ended up being impossible... then I found this sub and I almost cried I was so overjoyed at the thought of cheesy goodness. I live in National City, CA (which is in San Diego). Hoping to pay it forward when I get my financial aid check next week because I know how much of a struggle life can be and I believe karma is real..

SOL for a few days
All sob stories aside, I should be getting my unemployment check this week. We are very hungry and have 47 cents in the bank. I always pay it forward, and will as soon as unemployment goes through. 

There is a Dominoes at the end of my street and walking to it is no issue. There are other places that deliver as well, but I am too broke to tip. Sigh.

I'm moving into a new place today, and I'm super excited. If someone could be so kind as to help us christian our new place with some pizza, I'll make a plaque paying honor to you, and name my living room/recreation area after you.

You'd not only make this place more special, you'd also be an honorary member of our group!

it's funny how your mood can be crushed within seconds..
I was just fine, hungry but OK. I don't take kind to being yelled at in anyway. So my super awesome ( not seen often) good mood was just crushed like a bug. I have problems with depression and such. Comfort food is always nice though. I was going to offer to draw something in exchange.. I don't know if that will work out now. Hungry, depressed and hungry..pizza would be nice.:/ Thanks for reading

Things are finally starting to look up hopefully, but we're not out of the woods yet.
My parents and I have had a rough couple months of no income and occasional hospital visits, but luckily things are getting better and we're gonna be back on our feet soon. Unfortunately, we're about a week out from having money again, and after two months of zero income, we're hungry and sick of fried potatoes. If anyone could swing a pie or two our way, I'd be grateful and pay it forward as soon as I'm able. I'm in Washington, and near a Pizza Hut and Domino's. Thanks for reading.

Finally off disability, but not back to work full time yet. Things have been tight.
Back in September my fiancee and I were involved in a motorcycle accident which left me in the hospital and out of work until last month. 

My disability has run out and my doctor has only released me for 20 hours a week. I was used to working closer to 50-55 hours a week, so financially, we are in a bit of a pickle. 

She is only working part time and has limited work because of her injuries. 

We are scraping by, but just barely. Between her and I, the bills get paid, but there's not much left after to do anything with other than get the basics to get by for a few more weeks until one of us gets paid again. 

Pizza would be nice, we've basically have been eating like crap lately because it's all we can afford. 

I expect to start working more in the next few weeks, but I still need to go through my doctor to get released for more work which is why I'd prefer to not post elsewhere. We can get by without help, but eating the same thing over and over again is beginning to drive me crazy. 

If you'd like to help, thank you.

[46201] It's been a completely horrible day. 3 Adults could use Pizza.
Hey all. I've never actually gotten pizza from this sub. but tonight...well, I really could use it. No one wants to cook supper. We had to rush one of the cats to the emergency vet, and he did not make it. They said they were pretty sure it was cancer, and that to save him would have demanded $4K in painful and drawn out medical care. We could not possibly afford this, and we wouldn't have put him through the pain and scariness anyhow. He loved pepperoni, so I'm trying to get Tribute pizza from one of Pizza Hut, Papa John's, or Toppers.

I won't have any food until Sunday
Hi Random Acts of Pizza, I've never been gifted a pizza before, but I guess I'll try again. I really don't have anything to lose by asking, anyway. 
I'm a first-year college student who's currently between jobs. It's spring break at my school (FGCU, if you're interested in fact-checking me) which means that my meal plan is completely useless right now, as the dining hall is closed until Sunday, the 8th. I haven't had anything to eat since Sunday, and I'm ready to eat shoeleather at this point. If you, dear reddit, wouldn't mind helping a dumbass student who made a huge mistake a little less pained, I'd be much obliged(seriously, what possessed me to not check if the dining hall would be open during break?).
I have nobody I can rely on, but regardless, I don't think I'll die if I don't get a pizza. Either way, thanks reddit.
Edit: For grammar

I really could go for a pizza. (Australia)
I don't really know what to say, but I'll be as honest as I can.
My home situation is crap, my family are assholes (verbally, emotionally, mentally and physically) I'm the only daughter and the oldest yet my brothers get treated much more better and join in with my parents torment. I don't have a lot of money on me at the moment; they keep trying to take it when I'm trying to save up, there is barely any food in the house; I haven't eaten something since Monday night. I wouldn't have really posted here if I wasn't struggling with money, and I felt really hesitant to do so because I'm sure there are others in worse circumstances.

GA] On maternity leave, and short term disability pay doesn't start until Friday.
I had a perfectly healthy baby girl, and things have been going great with her, but me and her daddy are struggling financially. He has been looking for work and actually had an interview yesterday. We're waiting to hear back. We have been trying to eat at least once a day, but with my bank account in the negative, it has been a hard week for us. Thought I would try to reach out to you guys, a pizza would give us enough to eat for today and then leftovers tomorrow. Thank you guys for your time.

Philly Grad student with a paper due tomorrow, an incoming snow storm, and the hunger looking for $8 pizza.
Ive got a paper for a law class due tomorrow and will be trapped working on that all night. Would love a local pizza to tide me over. Bank account is low (but not dire) and I've gifted 'zas before.

Philadelphia - Angelinos (local) preferably. They have a $8 pie (traditional red) that I could walk to pick up. If you're opposed to Angelinos, Lazzos is close too.

If you instead want to use the Big 3, Dominos is the closest to me.

Thanks for taking the time to consider either way! :)

Lafayette, IN -- I have rice, peanut butter, and a negative bank account balance.. Can I maybe get a Pizza?
Once May comes, I should be stable, but right now, my cell phone provider just decided to charge me almost four hundred dollars in international calls I did not make. I tried to dispute the charges and they won't budge, so I'm out an extra two hundred dollars at the moment, and am facing fees from the bank because it put me just a few dollars past 0. I don't get paid until the 18th of this month, and yeah.. about that.. A pizza could probably feed me for like three days, and I have enough rice to fill the rest of the time between now and then. Yay rice.

I'm looking to return the favour for both this pizza, and the one I got a couple of months ago once I have the cash to spare. 

Thanks for your kindness, and for reading.

I've been helping people on /r/suicidewatch... would love a pie to keep me motivated.
So I'm often suicidal myself and one of the ways I work past it is helping others out of those dark situations. You can check my post history, I've been having a hard week and chatting with a lot of folks over there, both publically and privately. It makes me feel better helping people out, but is tiring work.

I would love it if someone is willing to get me a pizza. I can guarantee I'll be continuing to help folks out over at /r/suicidewatch regardless of whether I get one or not, but the pizza would be areally kind gift.

Thanks y'all. And remember, we're always here to listen, whether you be suicidal or not.

Coming here for help, will be ready to pay it forward soon!
Long story short I'm broke with little to no food options available to me for the time being.  I'm waiting on my tax refund that will get me back on my feet, as I have been for a period of time that is stretched beyond belief (yay government services!!!).  My taxpayer advocate told me it would be here BY the 9th, and she was very optimistic about it not being delayed at this point.

As soon as it comes in I will pay it forward gladly, but for now I could really use the help! 

Thanks for the read!

Just got back from a week long hospital stay with my boyfriend. Most of our food is rotten, and I would kill for a good hot meal after eating nothing but vending machine and hospital food.
[Boyfriend](http://imgur.com/a/qvS7d) just got a new temp job doing IT at a local hospital, and three weeks later came down with a terrible infection (which turned out to be MRSA) in a very [*delicate* place](http://imgur.com/a/L9ohJ)(SFW). After his fever hit 104 we headed to the ER, and didn't make it home till a week later.

I spent the whole week eating his leftover [hospital food](http://i.imgur.com/Ym6Z1eM.jpg), and stuff from their admittedly decent vending machine. A nice hot pizza would really hit the spot for both of us right now.

My unemployment is officially exhausted, but my fiancé just found work. Problem is he doesn't start until Monday, and we can't afford groceries yet because my unemployment is being deposited on Friday. However, we should be okay after that. If RAOP could help us out, it would be awesome.

A pizza for me to share with my Grandfather for his birthday. We've had it hard recently.
I'm a 24 year old nursing student living on £83 a month. I live with my 87 year old Grandfather and he lives off his pension. We have had financial trouble recently and I couldn't afford to get him more than a card for his birthday. We don't have much food in the house and I thought if someone would be nice enough to share a Pizza with us then his birthday would be a bit better. 

We live in the UK.

The sick irony of all this is I'm a chef. I've made food for thousands of people and yet can't afford to feed myself. best of luck to everyone trying to find food tonight.

SC - have asked a couple of times in the last month, to no avail.
long story short I would absolutely love a pizza for dinner tonight. I've been doing really well for myself lately and Papa John's has a $12 large pizza offer going on. I plan to pay it forward within the next couple of weeks if someone finds it in their heart to hook me up.

No money, no food, and now no job.
Not gonna make this too long, but I was recently laid off (applying for every suitable job I can, and actually had an interview this morning!) and everything I was paid has to go to rent. If anyone on this sub could help me out I would be very grateful and definitely pay it forward when I can.

Hello! We are a smaller team (four people) currently making a game for [Ludum Dare 32](http://www.ludumdare.com). We are stuck in a fairly small area while we work and would love some pizza to feed us a bit while we work! If you would be willing to purchase us some pizza today, I will make you one of the playable characters in our game! (Which is a deathmatch, so be aware that our characters will be dying with unconventional weapons. One of them being a desk lamp!) [This is a spawning animation](http://i.imgur.com/Lrblacq.gif) I made for one of our characters. We might not use the animation, but it's here to show the style we're making our characters in.

If you would like to take us up on this offer, I would also need a photo. Though to be honest, you could just tell me what you want on the character and I could make it.

Car troubles
My wife and I recently found out we need a timing belt repair for our '98 Subaru Outback, even though it was fixed just 2 years ago. With our car being worked on and tons of money out of pocket, we are a bit bummed and also can't drive out to buy food. 

It'd really brighten up our day if we could get a pizza, though! I haven't told her about this subreddit as I've been saving it for a proverbial rainy day, but I figured now would be a good time to reach out. We have all the main pizza places around here (Papa John's, Dominos, etc...). 

Thanks for taking the time to read my story.

Will be watching my Sens play alone tomorrow, a pie would be awesome.
I'm in Jacksonville, FL. There's a Dominos and all the other chains nearby. The boyfriend has work tomorrow till 1AM, so he won't be there to share my agony seeing my 0-3 Sens lose (most likely, prepare for the worst, hope for the best).. Money's tight and I'd like to drown my sports sorrow in warm, greasy 'za tomorrow.

My other favorite team is the Jax Jags if that helps you feel my pain..

Anyway, have a good one and best of luck in the playoffs for whoever you root for, unless it's the Habs.. I'm gonna have a grudge against you guys for awhile. Sorry!

Things are a little tense at home and a pizza would be nice to bring us together
I recently lost my job and am on the hunt for a new one but things haven't been going the best. I would like to surprise my wife and child with a pizza, but what little money I have needs to go in my gas tank to go job hunting. I have Steam keys for Dragon Age Origins, Dead Space 2, Bejeweled 3, and Mass Effect 2 that I could give you in return.

Unemployed, and down because I have to rehome my dog.
The last couple years have been rough.  I've been having trouble keeping jobs because of increasing difficulty with sleep disorders and mental illness.  It looks like I can no longer support myself, much less my dog of 3 years... so I made the difficult decision to rehome her.  Haven't had much to eat other than rice and some lentils in a few days...would love something else to drown my sorrows to.  Thanks.

I will write and perform a pizza-themed song for you!

It's a beautiful night here though my little cuz and I have yet to eat tonight and could really use some pizza in our lives. If you feel inclined to be our personal Cheesus Chrust I will write and perform w/ keyboard accompaniment an amusing song about pizza (or a non-pizza topic of your choosing) and upload it to YouTube for your viewing pleasure. I'm pretty good at it. Xoxo
Edit: Well no additional resources appeared in my pockets over night so this request/offer is still open. Jah Bless

A client has crewed me over with payment, so I'm totally broke since last week, would love a pizza, will draw as a thank-you :)
Hello. So as I've just found out it's not the bank who mess up with something, it's a client who "put the wrong account number by accident" as she tells. I'm so broke and really would be eternally grateful for pizza.
I'll draw whatever you want in return! :)
I'm in Poland, there's english version of online ordering site where you can pay via PayPal and cedit cards :)

Have a great day everybody :)

Sob Story - We lost our baby. We're out of money, food stamps don't kick in till the fifth. (Georgia)
This week has been one of the shittiest weeks of my and my girlfriend's lives. For the past month we have been coming to grips with becoming parents, but we went in to the ultra sound and there was no heartbeat... and this part may sound petty but it is really fucking with me. A friend sent me Bloodborne awhile back and now I'm stuck at a point where all the enemies are little mutated fetus creatures, which I could handle until we got the news... I'm sitting here eating canned potatoes and filling out application after application hoping to scrape by... Some pizza would be nice.

Will Sing A Song Of Your Choosing For Pizza.
You can either write a short poem and I will sing it or choose a song for me to do a quick rendition  on Vocaroo.

I'm really exhausted/hungry and have less than $2.00 to my name.
I'm no Stevie Nicks but I will try my best to impress my anonymous benefactor.

Will Sing for Pizza!

Could use a pick me up pizza after these last few weeks.
I hate to be one of those sad, give me pizza posts, however, I have had a rough few weeks and a pizza could really help. I have had strep throat and the flu these past 2 weeks, and because of this, my work sent me home. I found out this morning that they cut my hours significantly, and on top of it all, my boss is out of town and I have yet to be paid from the first of this month. I will write you a short story, draw you a fun cartoon, or pay you back in any way possible. Thanks for reading! 


Edit: I'm in Los Angeles, CA and there is a Pizza Hut and Dominos in my area. Thanks again!

Hungry broke college student
I just noticed I ran out of ramen noodles and my stipend from financial aid doesn't come until 2 weeks time. I can't really concentrate on studying for my economics competition when hungry so if anyone could pizza me that would be fantastic and hopefully I can return the favor later down the road!


Edit2: A irl friend invited me to a party and we all know what that means... FOOD! I won't need that pizza tonight after all. Most likely tomorrow but I hope there's enough at the party for leftovers.
Edit: Sorry, I forgot to mention I'm in Miami, Florida and there's a Pizza hut pretty close to me.

2 broke college kids
We only have $20 to our name at the moment. We would spend it on food but we both need to make it to work and we don't get paid till Friday. We haven't eaten today and would love a nice hot pizza. We promise to pass it on when we get a chance

North NJ - I am very poor and very hungry. May I please have a Pizza or Food.
I took the plunge and tried to make my own website at http://mobacat.com but it didn't really take off. I've been looking or jobs constantly for a while but not much in my area has responded. I've been on an all rice and pasta diet for a few months now. No butter or spices or anything left. Just the rice and pasta. Now I just have some rice left. Pretty sure there's some malnutrition stuff going on. It would be pretty cool if I could eat something else before the eviction comes in and all that. I haven't had anything with meat on it in a while. Any help would be appreciated. They have Dominoes delivery online in my area if that helps anything.

Broke college student, alone during the end of finals week.
All of my friends have finished their exams and are home for the summer. I'm here, in an empty apartment with 3 days and about 8 bucks to my name, which I am rationing for gas money, and the last couple cup of noodles I have from the semester. I've been waiting on a check from a client that still hasn't come in.

It would be a welcomed change to have some decent food, and start paying back in the form of pizza as soon as I get paid. Moscow, ID.

My toddler and I are sick of chicken and rice!
Hey everyone! We're a bit low on funds until the weekend and the only thing I have in the house is chicken and rice and beans and we're a bit sick of it ;) My toddler hasn't had pizza yet so I'm sure that would be a HUGE treat for him! I don't have a lot, but I do have this [dragon egg dice bag](http://imgur.com/kjPsIvT) that I crocheted that I would love to trade for a pizza!

Please help, I'm so hungry.
Hi everyone! I'm a graduating senior in college--graduating this Saturday. My college has a "senior week," a week between the last day of exams and actual graduation day. For a lot of people, this is a fun time to drink and hang out with friends before leaving school. For me, this week has just sucked. The caf has been closed since Friday, so my meal plan I saved up for all last summer is useless. I officially used up my last pack of ramen yesterday morning (I was trying to make a 6-pack last through this week), and I'm so, so hungry. If anyone can afford to get me a pizza, I promise to pay it forward x3 as soon as I get my first paycheck this summer. I'm happy to provide pictures of my 100% empty fridge/bank account, if you so desire. Thank you so much to anyone who is considering helping me out!
