Taking care of sick boyfriend and spent the last of my money on medicine
No job right now (college student) and the last of the money I had saved up was spent buying everyone Christmas gifts. I had $20 I was trying to make last for food but SO got super sick and needed meds. He seems to be getting better but now we're super hungry. If anyone could send a pizza our way, we'd really appreciate it and will pay it forward in the future.

Pizza for a bored, poor student home on break. Genoa, IL
Hello everyone, 

I'm in the wonderful, boring town of Genoa, IL, alone while my parents work, ordering books on Amazon. Could someone send me a smackerel of pizza? It would really warm my heart.

Ending the year overdrawn and hungry. Lend a hand?
Suffering from [autistic burnout](https://allspectrumgirl.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/what-is-autistic-burnout/), depression, and anxiety, which has made it difficult to keep working. I've been about sixty dollars overdrawn for a few weeks now and it's going to be a while before I can do anything about it. I've got Soylent, so I'm not going to starve, but it would be so nice to be able to have something tasty to eat tonight.

I fully intend to pay it forward on this sub as soon as I can afford to. Thanks for reading.

staying up late working - would love a pizza to go with this porn
I get paid once a month.....so tonight's my last night to earn before I send in my invoice tomorrow. So no drinking or going out or any of that for me tonight.

While I'm here working my way through the last 3 months of Brazzers content and then moving on to Playboy (totally not super cool, kids, lol I'm working in spreadsheets tonight! ...so ya know,  if I do this (o)(o), it makes boobs in there!) - 
....I wouldn't mind a pie from Dominos. 

I'll be getting paid next week and can gift a pizza to someone else or back to whomever sends it (if someone does) then. 

Thanks in advance &lt;3

[ATX] Gave up so much of myself this year I may never get back. Mostly my soul--money can do that to you. This next year I resolve to stay true to myself!
**Even after trying so hard, ended up with not so much--got evicted from my apartment (embarrassing), lost one cute boyfriend (a good thing), and then lost another cute boyfriend that I LOVED, and I mean LOVED sleeping next to.  He's gone, my roommates that I barely know are having a party with pizza--but they ate it all and because a bunch of kids were invited (awesome I love kids) I get to listen to pasty pop music.  I am genuinely sad.  It's WAY WAY too cold to go to any parties and commune with my fellow "wiccans" and "druids."  The roads are iced.  If anybody sent me a pizza, it would be this small, tiniest bit of happiness that I would forever remember.

I resolve next year to bring back my soul--even if it costs me all the money in the world.  Especially since I've already tried making money and failed miserably, I resolve to value my life more and get back the things I loved.  Becoming closer to Gaia, our Earth Mother, and not paying attention to things that are not meaningful in a lasting way.  (If any of this is even remotely possible!)

With pizza.

Was just thrown out for eating the pizza when I got home. The irony.
I don't even care that it's been a bit since I've eaten at this point. I'd like the pizza to give to them to make amends for this stupid situation.

I don't have a family, I moved out about 3 months ago because my mother had a mental break and tried to harm me. I live about a hundred miles from them with a friend I knew from high school. We planned to get an apartment together, but his step-parents offered us a home here until we got on our feet.  That was about 3 weeks ago.

They are a fairly frugal couple because they aren't rich. They conserve food, they feed themselves, and I was raised in an entirely different environment where food is there to be eaten. I wss never raised or taught otherwise. So I've been getting the sharp end of the stick recently for eating what's in the fridge, and as a result there's been a lot of being yelled at. A lot. I came from an abusive home and walked right into another. I'm at my limit and it's starting to affect my emotional capability because I don't feel like I belong here. I'm not like the people here. I'm not like the friend I'm living with. And I'm not being accepted for it.

I walked in after a late shift, saw some leftover pizza on the stove, and since payday's not til friday I'm broke and hungry here. So I eat a slice, and his dad walks in on it. Que the meltdown because I think it was his lunch for work tomorrow. So I left and am now sleeping in my car in a lot on the other end of this maybe 10 mile^2 town and I'm not sure I can go back because either I'm going to snap or I'm going to go back into depression. I can't keep living as an eternal fuckup.

All I want right now is to apologize. I can't do that with words because they have no respect for them. I want to be able to provide them with food for tomorrow. There's a casey's down the street that's 24/7. There's a dominos and pizza hut in town, but they don't open til 10am. The parents are usually gone for the day by 6am.


I don't know what to do here reddit. I'm falling apart, and my life has long since passed that itself.

Just Want To Have A Nice Lunch With My Hardworking SO
Hey, guys. I'll keep it short. I was wrongfully terminated from my job back in November, and the Equal Opportunity Commission process takes about 6 months here. Thankfully, I've found a new position, but they do not start until January 12th. My fiancee has been paying the bills, rent, and misc costs for the both of us since then, and its really straining on him. He is off work today for the first time in months (usually working 48 hours shifts) and I would love to surprise him with pizza he doesn't have to stress about paying for. I will pay it forward the day of my first check at my new place. Thanks for your consideration, and happy new year!

The winter has claimed me. I'm ill, my family have all gone elsewhere, the shops are too far away for my frail body and I'm trying to write my dissertation. Would super appreciate dinner being looked after for me, and I'm happy to draw something in return? (UK Student)
Urgh. I'm guaranteed to come down with something every winter, and this year's has finally claimed me. My family have gone to see friends over night, so I'm by myself. (Probably a good thing, hopefully I won't be contagious by the time they get back)

I'm a third year student at Uni so I'm also writing my dissertation, which is just not fun, by any stretch of the imagination. Guhhh.

That being said, I'm studying illustration, so I can draw you something? I can't promise you a finished piece, but send me a photo of you or your cat and I'll send something back.

I've given several times, and plan to again next time my student loan comes through. Check out my history for art/giftings.

Cheers for reading, have a lovely new year!

alone, poor, hungry and miserable in london
i'm f'in lonely. i'd call my parents but they died when i was 10. my only friend in the world is my ex from 10 years ago. 
i'm poor. no job. every time i get one it's strictly temporary, so there's no point in making friends as i'll be off again by the end of the week. as it stands i'm feeding myself by going out at 3am and looking for change to buy cheap tins of beans. some days (today included) i don't eat a thing at all. 
sorry if this is disjointed, i'm in a mess and hoping there's a kind soul out there who'll help a redditor out.

Completely out of food, and the thought of a pizza crossed my mind.
I'm a poor college student who, as I said in the title, is completely out of food and out of money. School starts in a few days, as does my meal plan, but I still have 3 days of no food ahead of me. If I'm gifted a pizza, around the end of January is when my loan disbursement should net me plenty of money, including enough to either gift you back a pizza or gift a random person one. Either way, thanks for this subreddit, and I'll keep my fingers crossed.

Been waiting for approval on apartment. Working tonight. Pizza for kids would be awesome.
Rental rates in Austin have gone through the roof. We have applied to reduced rent and lower cost apartments, but they are all full. We are living in an residence like hotel, but even having a stovetop and fridge, it doesn't have an oven. Life without pizza can be bland. Looking for a good samaritan to hook it up. Thank you for reading.

My supervisor approved my time-sheet late. I won't be getting paid for another two weeks.
I guess bad things come in three, yea? Well, I went to pick up my paycheck today and was informed that there was not one for me to pick up. Turns out my boss didn't get my time-sheet approved before everything was imputed. I'll be getting that pay-check, and my one that is due to me normally in a couple of weeks, but until then I'm broke without a whole lot of food in the mean time. A pizza would cheer me up, and also be really helpful.

Korea has some of the craziest, most random pizzas in the world. Eat one of them vicariously through me!
Pizza is Korea is absolutely insane. Literally - no sane person could've come up with these kinds of combinations... you want a shrimp and gouda pizza with a cream cheese crust and honey sprinkled on top? Yeah that's a real pizza. Potato and corn with ham and honey mustard? Completely viable.

Here's the deal.... if you pick a pizza from the following menus:

* [Dominos](http://www.dominos.co.kr/menu.do?todo=getMenuList&amp;gubun=PZ15)
* [Pizza Hut](http://pizzahut.co.kr/pizza/dough.do)
* [Mr. Pizza](http://www.mrpizza.co.kr/menu/allpizza)
* [Papa Johns](http://www.pji.co.kr/menu/pizza.jsp?cl_cd=1)- much tamer, similar to American Papa Johns.

I'll post a play-by-play with an in-depth description of the taste, texture, etc. along side pictures. 1,000 Won is approximately $1US.

Tomorrow's my fiance's birthday!
Hihi. Tomorrow's my fiance's birthday, and I think it'd be pretty cool to him to come home to a pizza. He's not going to be able to spend his birthday doing much, since rent was just due and we were short a 50 or so (woops).

I draw as a hobby, so I'd be willing to pay for a pizza in drawings. They aren't the best, but they're something I really enjoy doing, and plan to work on. It'd be nice to use this as an excuse to draw for the first time in a month.

I posted yesterday and it seemed to get some upvotes but no pizza. Well, I'm off of work today and I don't have the funds to acquire the cheesy goodness that is pizza.

Recently got scammed as a freelancer, could use a meal tonight
Hey all,

I work as a freelance programmer (coder) as an aside to going to school in Toronto, ON, CA. I came home for the Christmas break and have the second term off, but my parents have left today to go on a vacation and I'm left to fend on my own.

This wouldn't be so bad if the "client" I had recently spent a month of work for had paid up, but instead they said "the project was dead" and didn't want to pay me. I have no money left after spending most of it getting home but I had enough to buy my train ticket home tomorrow. I'd love if someone could hook me up with a pizza for tonight and if I can convince this guy that I deserve pay, I'll pay it forward.


Thanks
EDIT: Forgot to include region: Chatham, ON, CA - we have Domino's, Little Caesar's, Pizza Pizza and a few locals

Hi everyone. I have never done this.
Hi redditors. I'm currently working on an engineering degree and live at home with my family. My 5 and 8 year old sisters love extra cheese pizza, my mom loves combination and me and my brother along with my 15 year old sister love meat lovers with stuff crust from Pizza hut. We have not had it in years because little cesars is cheaper. PM me if you want to ask any personal questions. Thanks for reading.

Have no money for food! 3rd night in a row. Promise to return the favor!
HI. My name is Kurt and I'm 21! I've just been so taxed with the lack of work days I've had these past holidays. I spent everything on rent and taking friends and family out, I haven't had money to eat.

If someone were willing to send me some pizza by the end of tonight, I'd be very inclined to return the favor by the end of this month and pay it forward to another stranger as well.
It's about 9:30 here in Canoga Park, CA and I'm probably not going to be able to sleep until around 1AM! 

I appreciate anyone's consideration, if even internal. You're all wonderful anyway. :)

down on my luck and could really use some pizza
I've just been down on my luck these past few months and would just really appreciate having something nice to eat and especially a pizza lasts me like 2 days, and today is even 2x1 in all places near me so it ends up being like 4 days of food. I'd gladly take 4 days of pizza over another 4 of ramen.

College kid
Hey all! If you creep through my history, you'll see I've posted here before (when I was living in Boston.) Unfortunately the person who said that they'd buy me dinner backed out, which sucked.

Now I'm back at school. Classes haven't started yet, but I came back early to meet my roommate (I live with foreign exchange kids, so a new one each semester) but she's MIA. Which is terrible. So I'm up on the Canadian border, alone, in the freezing cold, wishing for pizza.

If you're interested, I go to Clarkson University, so if you're an alumni, Let's Go Tech!

I can barter with graphic design skills, or just being a listening ear. We can chat about the upcoming premier of Agent Carter. 

Anyhow, that would be lovely if you could get me the Pizza Hut dinner box ($10) so I could have a couple meals out of it.

Other than home-made pizza from scratch two months ago, which I don't have the ingredients for and I'm not allowed to eat out because "we have food in the house", per the wife...

Anyone feeling generous? Help a pizza-less man?

Husband, child and I just moved into a new home! We'd like to celebrate it, but we're short on money because of it
It took a little over a week, and a LOT of driving back and forth, and that gas money kinda put us out a lot of funds. We're finally hoping to get everything done by tomorrow, and it's going to be our busiest day yet, finding places for all our stuff! 

So, we'd love it if we didn't have to cook anything, and could just relax with some awesome pizza tomorrow night (1/7/15) &lt;3

sad trans girls (and friends) could really use some pizza
Hi! I'm Justine. I'm a 22 year old, recently dumped transgender girl living in Charlotte, North Carolina: and I could really use some pizza. Story time! You know what I spent today doing? Nothing. Literally nothing. I left my bed once to go to the bathroom, but other than that I didn't eat. Or drink. Or sleep really. I was dumped last night, by a man that controlled me emotionally and financially for *two years*. I was left by him- for the better- but desperately sad, alone, and used. I feel pretty empty but I managed to get up the courage to ask for a favor. I don't need money. I'll find a job- I'll find something. I don't want any superfluous act of charity. I'm a big girl. I made my mess, and now I'll lie in it. But me and my roommates could really use some fucking pizza. Pizza is my ultimate comfort food. I ate it the night my parents divorced (Little Caesar's). I ate it the day my mom passed out drunk on New Years after eating too many prescription pills (Pizza Hut). I ate it the night I found out my Mom died (Domino's). I just don't really have ~~any~~the money right now to be eating out. If you decide to help that'd be cool! I might even shuffle you some pictures because, hey, I'm single. But at any rate, thanks for listening to my soap box. Here's hoping for some pizza :) - Justine Catherine (ps I'm on my friends reddit acct bc I don't have one, hence why I didn't sign off An Thorne)

for some dinner tomorrow night?
My roommates and i have just moved into our new apartment last week. After getting evicted and spending 3 days with no electric or heat in our new apartment things have finally settled down a good bit. Downside we still have no money for food. Was thinking i would give this a shot and see if anyone could help us out and get us a pizza for dinner tonight because we have a cup of yogurt and some questionable celery as the contents of the refrigerator. We would be extremely grateful for it. Thank you~

Bummed out college kid about to be kicked out of school because I can't pay.
more info: For some reason this year my usual financial aid left me about $6,000 short of what I needed. Classes start Monday but even if any of the loans I've tried to apply for go through, chances are they won't be here in time for me to not get kicked out of my dorm this semester. At this point I've done all I can so all I can do is wait and hope. Some food would make the wait a bit less stressful.

broke college student just moved in for a new semester to an empty kitchen, please help?
Hey, I just moved in to my new house. I've been here for 3 days and have run out of the little bit of food I brought with me, and don't have any funds for grocery shopping. A pizza is 2 days of meals for me, help a girl out?

EMT here. I hate to ask for help, but it would really be great tonight. If anyone would be so kind, there are Domino's and Papa John's and Papa Gino's in the area. Thank you to anyone who could help out.

An arctic journey stands between me and my paycheck.
I plan to stay inside until the spring, or more realistically all day. The snow is too much to bear. I can only find 1 sock right now, and if by some miracle I manage to find the other; there's no way in hell I'll risk getting them wet in the snow.

Having trouble getting my foodstamps, ate the last of our food last night.
My SO and I have been having problems getting our foodstamps. Placed multiple calls, left messages, nobody has gotten back to us. Our paychecks went to rent, and dont get paid for another 10 days(rather be warm and hungry than homeless with food). We ate the last of our food last night(rice). Our apartment buildings boiler brokedown, so our heat went out and pipes froze so no running water. I'm trying to surprise my SO with a pie. It would definately brighten her spirits. Thanks for taking the time to check out the post. Its much appreciated.

The Wight Walkers have come to West Michigan...
[First Horn Blast]

Oh, my sweet summer child, what do you know about fear? 

Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years, and children are born and live and die all [without Pizza]. That is the time for fear, my little lord, when the Wight Walkers move through the woods [looking for Pizza]... Thousands of years ago, there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their [Pizza] huts, and women smothered their babies rather than see them starve [without Pizza], and wept, and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? 

[Second Horn Blast]

Quite the snow storm has come to West Michigan. Normally West Michigan is hit hard with snow due to lake effect. Which means that if Chicago is hit with 8" of snow, we get 14"-16". This compounded with -17° wind chill means your life is now a metal album. Cars refuse to start. The harsh winter crows fall dead out of the sky. Today I swear I saw a wight walker riding on a dead frozen horse. Fortunately, a pizza hut delivery guy hit it with his car. Pizza might be our only savior.

[Third Horn Blast]

The night is long and full of Terrors...

It may be better to give than to recieve...
... But looking at my bank balance, I think only the latter is open to me. 

Broke college student starting up classes after the weekend, waiting for the GI Bill money to come. I've got some dollar store mac and cheese, and I've got chili, so I won't starve without, but a pizza to divvy up across the weekend would certainly kick it up a notch. 

So, does anyone want to help out a recent gifter with a pie?

Almost employed for the first time in three years.
I am autistic, have been habitually homeless, and am currently caring for my autistic spouse who is going through a major depressive episode, which means we have had no income for over three months. I've been working extremely hard the past few weeks and am very close to getting a middle-class wage job in internet security / triage.

Having some validation would help me keep going and not mess this up, and having something to cheer up my spouse would be a great relief as well.

We'd really like something from Papa John's, and if I recall correctly, they are issuing $25 gift cards with a particular purchase.

Thank you in advance.

So I currently am a student and don't really have any spending money for food other then the necessary groceries. I don't ever get to go out to eat anymore. But anyway Papa Johns has a buy one get one free pizza meal so I was wondering if someone could buy me that deal? I would greatly appreciate the change in meal, and I would eat forever off of it!

I'm in the Philly suburbs, and am tired of eating canned carrots/peas. Help me Obi-Acts Ofpizza. You're my only hope.

canada] Assist us in cheering up a friend who just lost his Pa
Hi. Not very long ago, a good friend of boyfriend's father passed away. He's been totally closed off from the world, and was simply not coping well.. He's called my boyfriend and asked if he could come over and 'try to get on with life." He of course said Yes, come over, we'll play some board games, and we'll make you dinner. He calls me me to inform me of his sudden plans, and I'm kinda freaking out. All we have left is Soup, and some chicken legs. Not enough to really feed two people, let alone enough for a third. So I come here, asking if someone will help me raise our friends spirits, and save us from asking the guy to reach into his own pocket (he already had to cough up funeral expenses! and DAMN there are costs you wouldn't believe associated with it:() ANywho,  we are Canadian, the closest pizza places to us are, Pizzahut, Dominos, Panago, and I think Boston Pizza is opened nearby. If you need another info PM me. He wont be showing up until 8pm (1:30pm now) we plan on playing Smallworld (new game we just got) and some variety of Munchkin, that should distract the guy from sadness for a bit right?

Good ol' Fashioned pizza request
Hey all, I've been really craving that cheesy saucy goodness as I haven't had it in quite a while. Opened up my wallet to see I don't have cash left to order or pick-up. Thought I could post here and see if anyone would be awesome enough to get me one :D would really appreciate it. Any kind of pizza would do, you could even surprise me with the toppings, lets see how creative you can be. 

Will post pictures and will pay it forward with another pizza sometime next week for someone in the subreddit. 

I live in Mississauga, Ontario

That's about it, really. I've got half a 12 pack of beef ramen to last me until my next check, and I'm overwhelmingly hungry. PM me if you're feeling generous, otherwise keep fighting the good fight. Or, give up and cry. Both of these things are viable options.

My New Years resolution this year is "No Alcohol 2015". I was at a party on Friday which ended Saturday at around 10pm. I was so high on sugar and the other guys buzz that I didn't really fall asleep until around midnight. Woke at around 4pm here Sunday.

Loving this "No Alcohol" I got myself set up for. I think this will be a brillant year!

(Ohio) Hungry, cold, and broke till Thursday
Hi everyone, so last month I missed a week of work, unpaid, due to having to take care of my mother's funeral. As a result my last paycheck was quite short, I wasn't able to really get many groceries and as of yesterday the only food left in my house is minute rice. I'm really really tired of minute rice, and I have to last on half a box until Thursday when I get paid. So I'm asking if anyone would be willing to do me a solid and get this gal a pizza. I can usually make a pizza last me at least 3 meals or more, and times like this I can typically drag myself out to 1-2 meals a day. Which means this pizza could potentially last me through lunch Tuesday thus meaning I could make my rice stretch till I get paid! :D

Hey, everyone as the title says I'm home alone and broke til Friday, which is when I get paid and people comeback. Which kind of sucks since I would of loved to throw a house party this time around.

They said their payment system is down and they don't know when we'll get paid. I asked them when it went down and was told yesterday. I used the cash I had left for cat food. I would rather go hungry before him. Im so upset I cried in the plasma center. I know its not supposed to be relied on as income but i had no choice. Can anyone send a pizza our way please?

Need a writer? Sellsword willing to sell out for food.
Long story short. Some time ago I had a job as an IT manager. You know how that goes, you go in for the technical end and end up dealing with assholes in management after a promotion or two.

I quickly realized that I am doing fuck all with my life. The "career" promised to me as a juvenile fuckwit  in trade school never materialized. 

I asked myself, what do I REALLY want to do? I want to write. I dropped out. For a while I made my bread working for an essay mill. Write up penny per word to help incompetent fucks graduate. 

Technical white papers, anything to get you your PhD sir! I should have been given awards time and time over. Now, I starve.

I will write your magnum opus. I will do it for the pittance of a meager slice.

Any subject, anything at all. I a reduced to begging on the internet. 

If there is anything I can say, any advice I can give, it would be "DO NOT FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS!" It doesn't pay.

It's been rough. Last week we took our cat to the vet (so far he's doing much better), and today we had to take one of our rats. We found out she has cancer, and none of the vet clinics here can do anything about it. Short on cash and would really love a pizza. (Wichita, KS) As a thank you, I could send you pictures of my animals. I have 2 cats and 3 rats. Trust me, they're all cute as hell.

So payday is Friday, but I'm off Wednesday and Thursday. I've donated plasma to get some gas and food for the dog and cats, but now I'm all out of cash. I'm not going to starve, but pizza sure sounds nice for tonight or the next two days. I'm in Austin, TX if that makes a difference. Thanks for doing what you do!

Left lunch at home - asshole cats have most certainly conquered my forgotten sandwich. R.I.P. Sammie
Hello there! My lunch is on my book shelf at home right next to my travel coffee mug. My cat Luke distracted me on my way out this morning with his adorable asshole face and I forgot both! Don't you hate it when you do that? It's like my whole day has been thrown off. I'm sure by now Luke and his sister Princess Leia have broken into my lunch and are napping after the sweet victory that was my turkey sandwich.

Want to make this strangers day via pizza?! (BONUS: you will also be providing me dinner and lunch tomorrow! WOO!) 

I'm located in the US. Thanks! :)

will write a poem for some pizza and garlic sticks
Hey guys I'm in NYC and my cash is currently going to transportation for school. 

I'm not in dire need or anything so you can pay it forward to someone that is 

I don't get home from class until around 11pm and it'd be great to have some pizza and garlic sticks waiting for me. 

I don't NEED the pizza. I just want the cheesy goodness and I'm sure my brothers would appreciate it as well (if I share)  

I am willing to write a couple of corny poems to get my needs met :P

Broke (almsot) collage kid in need of pizza. Will return favor to another rando in a week!
Heyo, dropped out of high school because of extreme family issues, taking education part time to fulfill the requirements for the collage in my area. Spent all my money for the week, waiting for the paycheck on Friday,  hoping I can repay, or just give if I don't get.  

~ Edit: Heh:  college -_-

Extremely broke looking for a job, and half hopes.
I actually posted last night, and got a reply, but after a few msg's back and for he stopped replying and I'm starved at the moment.

manditory sob story: I have $20 in my account at the moment, and about -$11k on my credit line without student loans involved. sad thing is I don't go to school anymore, or at least not for another term. I was going to university here in Halifax, NS Canda.-and I decide that the courses I was taking were not anything I was interested in doing for the rest of my life, so I left the school and got accepted into a college program of my dreams! its actually the 2nd time I'm accepted, but the first time I was too worried about what kind of career I would get in it and decided jsut to go to university like the rest of the people I knew (different school though). 

I'm extremely excited to start the new course, but in the mean time I have to find a way to pay rent and my bills and food. I have $20 that has to last me until I find a job, and rent is coming up soon. 

Not sure how I'm going to do it, but I'll find a way. basically I just need a little bit of help to keep me going until I get over this financial rough patch

Edit: Hilarious side note, I live next to a Bread warehouse.

Just started a new job at McDonalds, completely broke until my first paycheck in two weeks. I'd really love a pizza
$.45 in my checking. Nothing in my pockets. Toppers Pizza would be unbelievable, but anything would be fantastic. Any decent sized pizza can sustain me for days. I'll pay it forward as soon as I can

survived two weeks on $20, help me survive my last day before my next paycheck.
I'm not sure how it happened, but I had bills and rent to pay all at once, had to get gas, and somehow ended up with a dry bank account. I ended up with 20 dollars and whatever groceries I could buy with that. Also had a few friends buy me food so I'm super grateful to them but I have one day left to get through. I could go the whole day without eating and I think I'd be fine until my check hits but I'd really enjoy some pizza.

Too tired and sick to cook, a pizza would help brighten my incredibly crappy day :)
So, I spent today going to the doctor, getting my blood drawn, and then trapped in a car with a guy who felt the need to detail all the stories from Vietnam that gave him PTSD. Then I finally got home, and I'm hungry, too exhausted and sick to cook and my neighbours are once again fighting.

Pizza me?

Broke and left with debt. Meat lovers Pizza would be nice.
My ex that i just broke up with in December after i gave her everything. Even givin up soda and eating out. But she kept abusing me and just making me feel like shit because i didnt want to change for her and after we broke up she decided that she was gonna leave me in debt with bills and rent. Along with taking my xbox 360 and all my games. Then i had to buy a new tire because she had slashed it. She had also taken a jacket my friend gave to me before he went into the military and a jacket my mom got me for christmas of 2014. The worst thing she did was break all my down steams, bowls and 3ft 6 pronged zong. But luckily a friend of mine said he would give me half of what i owed and that he would move in to help me out untill i get a job and he moved in tonight and we wanted to celebrate but realized we had no money. So if you guys could would find it in your pizza hearts to order me a pizza that would be greatly appreciated

I hate to ask, but me, my mom, my dad, and my sister are hungry and can't go to the food bank until saturday.
Hi! Please don't mind my username, this is my main account.(lots of people judge me because of my username). Anywho, this is how we got in this predicament, and I really need some help.

 I have a cornea disease called keratoconus and I'm required to wear specialty contact lenses which cost me about 600 dollars every year for one lens. While I was cleaning my lens it broke in between my fingers. I'm totally blind without this lens and had to immediately call the doctor and get a new one.  They let me do half up front and do the other half in payments but that $300 was my families food budget for the rest of the month. I'm a full time college student and I had no choice but to get the lens. My brother will be giving me a loan on friday, but we are hungry tonight and won't have anything to eat tomorrow. My mom is going to the food bank on saturday to help make things easier until the end of the month. If there is anything you guys can do we all would really appreciate it.

Thanks in advanced to anyone that can help.

Birthday Plans Cancelled due to clients not paying their bills.
Actually, my birthday was yesterday, but I didn't think about posting here.  I had originally made plans with some friends to go out for dinner and drinks, but had to cancel as none of my clients had paid their bills and entertainment is the first thing to go when funds are low.  So I spent my birthday arguing with a pedantic contractor telling me how to do my job (that I've been doing for 20 years) and watching pixar movies.  Not my worst birthday, but not my best.

If someone Pizza's me, I will Pizza 5 (yes that's right FIVE!!) more users who will receive this precious gift in the next month (What a great deal, she must be crazy!)
No, not crazy, just really love pizza. Unfortunately, I am really broke right now. Fortunately for you though, my financial state is going to be on the up and up very, very soon. 

I haven't had a pizza that wasn't a $5 Hot-N-Ready for so long, I think I've forgotten what Pizza Hut tastes like. 

I'm not sure what proof I can post, but I am completely serious about paying the pizza forward multiple times over. For the moment, I'm at work hoping I can make $5 in tips to get to Little Caesar's after my shift. (Did I mention it's my "time of the month" and, I really, really don't want to cook tonight?)

Anyway, whoever Pizzas me will be the first I pay back. Waiting on my banker to finalize some things or whatever. It took him a week or two to get back to me with money for my car, so this is normal, just annoying.

Possible for me to pick up pizza?
Hi guys, to make this super short, I've been sleeping in my car for the last several months since I've been having trouble landing some work.  Throughout the day I am usually at one of my local libraries self-studying or job hunting.  It's not at all terrible.  In fact, when I find work again, I may just buy a small van to sleep out of it for a year to save up for a house.  The things we need to do sometimes... 

Anyhow, it is obvious that I do not have a physical address however there is a Papa John's and a Domino's near me (zip code 33611).  I love combination pizzas with garlic butter sauce. A smaller size would be best for me since I have nowhere to store leftovers for now.  So is it possible for me to pick-up?  The posts I see here are for delivery so I don't know how it usually works.

I am on SNAP (food stamps) but can't buy warm, ready-made foods with it.  I'm stuck buying cold sandwiches, fruits, or canned/boxed stuff.  

Thanks guys!

Ran out of canned goods, a pizza would be amazing right now.
Hey Ive been using canned goods that my sister doesnt need for a few days now. I would just ask for a bit more but shes in another city at the moment. I do actually have a job but i dont get paid money until i see my boss this saturday. I just need a little something to get me by until then. I know how to space my rations out so i wont be hungry. Anything would be a blessing for me.

Could really use a pizza, just got out of the hospital and am on a no work order. Will return the favor to someone else when I can.
I just got out of the hospital after seven days.  I could really use a pizza but I am on a no work order so I don't really have the money to spare.  My parents are in New York with my Grandma who prolly won't make it through the night.  I know I sound like I'm making it up,  but I promise I'm not.  

If someone does this for me,  I vow that when I go back to work I will return to the subreddit and I will return the favor for someone else. 

Also,  if someone is willing to help me,  I'm not sure exactly how this works so you'll have to walk me through it.  :)

I've been super duper sick AND just started a new job. Pizza heals, right guys?
Hi there from Austin, Tx.

Just started a new job after a a very, very lean winter spent working a job that unexpectedly cut my hours due to weather (it's an outdoor job).

I've been sick all week, faking it until I make it at my new job. When I'm not at work, I'm basically plastered to the couch watching Netflix, hacking up a lung, drinking tea, and cuddling my tiny cat [Zoe](http://imgur.com/AQPCkQN).

Should someone feel so inclined to send a pizza my way, I'll be sure to pay it forward when I can.

I've never requested a pizza before, so let me know if I forgot to include any important info.

*edit* oh, and I did the whole "verification" doohickey

Frustrated and could use a pick-me-up pie.
I have a chicken breast in the fridge of which my father yelled at me to cook. *Okay*. I intended to, but whatever.. 


As I'm starting to prep for cooking (I'm prepping my prep), he asks what I'm doing. When informed that I intend to cook the chicken and make fajitas I get yelled at because "that means [I'll] make a fucking mess," and am told not to cook. 



Now I'm laying in bed, confused and mad, I definitely don't know *what* he wants from me. I could use a cheesy and delicious pie to calm my nerves because I'm about to snap. 



Thanks for taking the time to read this. Even if I don't get a pie at least I got to rant a little- so that's nice.

Terrible day including a hospitalized parent, not having smokes, and being broke. A pie would definitely help.
My dad took my mom to the hospital earlier today and still hasn't come back yet. Apparently they're gonna be keeping her overnight, which means he'll be there with her. That leaves me without money (dad's on medical leave and I can't find a job for the life of me), without anything in the house to eat, and to top it all off, he took our last pack of smokes with him.

Needless to say, I could definitely use a pie, and would definitely pay it forward as soon as I possibly can.

I'm in Washington, Domino's is the only one in range that'll deliver.

I thought I might give this a shot. (Portland, OR.)
Hi,

I'm wondering if anyone would help a brother out with some pizza. I'm not as hard out as some folks, but I am in a bind. I am working on my dreams of being a brewer, but that dream is not the best paying. I have no money till I get paid on Friday and the only meals I get are the ones I get when I'm working. That leaves my weekend to a half jar of peanut butter (Luckily I love peanut butter). 

I dont feel like i'm ready or deserving to use resources like r/food_pantry, but I love the idea. Hopefully someday I can be on the giving end.

pizza poem.
No idea if people are still into this sub as it seems a lot of people are annoyed with requests but I felt it is worth a shot. But for everyone here is a pizza poem....not by me but still enjoy ......

A pizza for breakfast, a pizza for lunch
A pizza for dinner, I would love to munch

Let it be round, let it be square
If it’s a pizza, I really don’t care

Pizza with pepperoni, pizza with cheese
I’ll have another and more of these.

My pizza is hot, my pizza is yummy
Hear that growl? That’s my tummy.

Thin crust or deep pan, vegetable or meat
Roasted or grilled, melting in the heat

Olives and tomatoes, onions and bell pepper
On Parmesan or ricotta, mozzarella or cheddar

Top it with cheese, herbs and spices
I’ll eat it whole, no need for slices.

Crispy and zesty, tasty and crunchy
All these have made me a big pizza junky

Take my burger, have my sandwich
Stare if you want, beg if you wish.

Smell the aroma, just don’t come near.
That’s my pizza and I’ll never share.

No food in house, need to get through the day at least.
Hello, I'm kinda new to this whole begging-for-stuff-from-strangers thing. I'm living at home with my parents due to an inability to find a job, and both of them are on disability due to a very long history of illnesses. (cancer for my mother, seizures and multiple breaks in my step father's back, among much more for both) We shouldn't be as bad off as we are due to my father having to pay child support, but he hasn't sent a single payment since I was 8. (I'm 19 now.) They go around to the local churches and financial institutions and get as much help as they can, but that plus their SSI isn't enough when it comes to getting enough food and paying the bills.They'll get their next check in about a week, but until then we've got a grand total of $20 to live on, thankfully with the bills already paid. My mother's health condition is declining, and due to an accumulation of bruises all over her body, a lack of appetite, immobilizing pain in her torso, and a very malpractice-prone local hospital, she was taken to a hospital a full county over the other day and they checked her out thoroughly, and she's come down with a bladder infection, and she's been shown to have fluid pressing against her lungs, along with a possibility of Leukemia. She's being taken to a blood analyzation specialist at that same hospital again, to see if anything else could be wrong. As the title says, there's no food to eat and they'll be gone for at least a full day. A pizza or two would be absolute heaven. I'd really appreciate it if someone would be able to spot me for the day, I'll be sure to pay it forward when I can. I'm posting this early in the morning, before they leave, so I can hopefully have this squared away and not worry all day. Thanks in advance.

Note: about my verification code, I had to request it twice because my browser crashed before I could copy it the first time. (thanks firefox)

EDIT: Don't take this as an emergency or anything, if things get dire, I've got a friend's place I can go to, I've just had to ask them for help a lot recently and don't want to be that one mooch-y friend who's nothing but a pity sink.

[UK] I'm back and broke again after my bank decided to be an ass. A pizza would be lovely.
So basically for whatever reason my bank decided to take £30 from my account leaving it £15 in the red. I've only got a few packs of noodles left, and I don't get paid until Friday.

A pizza would cheer me up a lot.

Damn International Delivery Rules!!!
Hi. I posted 5 days ago with a request,[Here It Is](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/2scrxz/request_after_being_unemployed_for_a_month_i_just/) and unfortunately the kind redditor who wanted to help me out is having massive issues with ordering a pizza for me (Lincoln, NE) from where he is (Australia).  Long story short, I'm still pizza-less, and still offering to complete a task in exchange for this pizza. Thanks for looking guys! Happy Monday! I hope you all have a positive, productive week. :)

I could definitely use a pizza right now - Raleigh NC
My girlfriend of 6 years that I move to raleigh with left me for a coworker she's been secretly seeing. Because of the gap in pauperism from December to January, I am struggling in finances right now. If anyone wants to help a guy out while he's down - Id be very appreciative.

will write you a poem or a short story of your choosing.
I've been broke and trying to get food the last couple days, but then I thought maybe I'd get lucky here. 

You can either: 
* give me an idea/plot you wanna see, 
* list a group of words and I'll make them into a story/poem
* find a writing prompt and tell me how you would want it played out. 
Idc! Anything, and I'll try my hardest! I've got a couple stories on Nosleep, I'll pm you info if you wanna read my writing! 

I've got a 2 year old stinker and a husband, so anything would be very very appreciated!!!

Some programming fuel would be nice (Spain)
I'm currently working in a little programming project and, as many of you probably know, pizza is the best fuel one could have to keep things going. So, as I'm a full time student and all I can afford eatting is rice or ramen, I would appreciate if any of you, awesome people of reddit, could send me a pizza so I can keep working and finally get some money out of programming so I can buy my own pizzas. I'm located in Spain so probably the chances are low but contact me anyway.

Thanks.

need pizza for ninja turtles party
I am having a ninja turtles party next monday for grown ass adults.  I have the movie in 3D, special ninja turtles 3D glasses from ebay, an adult onesie Rafael pajama, and booze and bud ready in preparation for the party.  I simply don't want to spend more on this ridiculous party that's essentially just a movie night. I just found this subreddit so I figured I'd give it a shot. I have a job but im cheap so if you want to make it rain pizza next monday night, awesome.  Otherwise I will be making some foodhacks tortilla pizza abominations.

Second miscarriage in a year; kind of bummed and pizza would be awesome.
Hi RAOP! Just to put this out there from the start -- we are not starving. I have food in my kitchen to cook if I need to. 

I've had my second miscarriage in a year this weekend. We have one kid, and would like another eventually -- and even though we're not in the ideal spot financially for a new baby, we're both a little upset about it even though I didn't know I was expecting until the MC happened. And of course on top of the emotional part, it's not a fun process physically. Right now my Mother in Law is staying with us and honestly I just don't feel like cooking tonight, so a pizza would be hugely appreciated if someone feels like giving!

Last trade offer didnt go through, now just looking for pizza
I tried to trade a card for a card and the person stopped sending me messages. It was kinda shady so I didnt pursue it. Anyway, I'm running low on funds until next payday and it would be nice if someone could hook me up with some pizza

I could do something in return. Anything music related. Or anything to do with computers or programming. Or whatever.

Thanks

I'm home alone and having a bum day.
I have never done a request before but I thought I would give it a shot. Today I was going to hangout with my mum, because it was my day off from school but she got called into work last minute. So I have been laying on the couch having a SAO marathon by myself all day. I just noticed the time and I am really hungry but unfortunately our fridge is empty because we never made it to the store. This isn't a sob story or anything, I'm just having one of those days where I don't feel so good and really don't want to leave the couch. :)

Edit: I don't need much just a $14 Pizza Hut GC so that someone can give to someone else too!

First day off in 3 weeks, house to myself, pizza in bed sounds like heaven.
I moved in to a new place about 2 months ago, I haven't had pizza since before then. I miss the way the cheese strings off and gets stuck to my face, sauce caked up on the corners of my mouth and the way my breath kind of smells like garlic afterwards.  Pizza sounds absolutely heavenly right about now.

Basically the title says it all. I didn't choose to move out but let's just say my living environment wasn't the best. It's really hard to pay rent and go to highschool, I can't work as much to support myself. Pizza would be heaven. Currently sitting at a dollar in my bank account.

New here and need a little help please...
I'm not here to share a sob story for free pizza, I'm not here to scam for free food, I'm in a pickle after losing my job in Oct and haven't found a new one yet. I don't ask for help online or in life but my options have run out, I live with my husband who has been trying to go to school for two years now and because of our bad luck he hasn't been able too, we spent our savings on rent, and household things, such as toilet paper etc.. We've been living on Ramen and dollar store food (which isn't bad at all) but after job interview and job interview we still haven't found a job and now are out of money. I'm hoping to find someone on here willing to help us out, we've been out of food for three days and we'll be more then happy to pay it forward in the near future. Please someone, anyone, help? Thank you Oh I got verification code as well and live in Tucson, AZ

New job after a long unemployment period, no paychecks for a while. Completely broke. A pizza or two would get me through the next few days.
I've been having a really shitty 4 months. My lease ran out in September, and my girlfriend and I were barely able to pay rent. I had a decent job with a temp agency, but my girlfriend decided to get a third shift 12 hour job 50 miles away. This put a huge strain on our relationship because we weren't living together anymore and we never got to see each other. I had to start living in the city she was working in and quit my job to find one there. We saw each other a little more after that because she would stay at the house I was crashing at a few days a week. My car was also breaking down regularly, so all the problems I had to face just to be able to afford my own place were quickly making me depressed. During this time, my girlfriend (I guess we can call her Charmander) was spending more and more of her free time in the twin cities 50 miles away with her new friends she met through Facebook. She would text me less every day. We became distant. She has a ton of emotional problems, but she never seemed to understand my depression. That just made us more distant. She would also start drinking pretty much whenever she didn't have to work. After a long week of her staying with her friends in the cities I called her and she broke up with me on the phone. I held onto hope that we would get back together because I understand her emotional problems often cause her to make decisions that she wouldn't normally do. She was still staying at the same place as me for a week or so, and I quickly noticed that she would drink quite a bit every day. Three consecutive days she was the drunkest I had ever seen her. Just before new years she was still here and I decided that I was going to ask her to stay at her parents. I thought they would be able to help her because there was no way they would let her drink there. When I went to talk to her, she was already completely wasted. She got extremely angry at me in front of two of my friends and drunkenly confessed to cheating on me with a guy in the cities. It destroyed me. After she left, the next few days were absolute shit. I've been trying to get over everything but life is just getting to me hard. I can't get her off my mind no matter what I do. We talk a little and she has apologized. I don't know if I can trust her again but she's the only thing in the world that I want. I don't know what she really wants. I'll admit I haven't been a great boyfriend. I've let unimportant things take over. This is getting really fucking long so I'll wrap it up with a tl;drTl;dr I have $.45 to my name and my McDonalds paycheck won't get here for a few weeks. I've been feeling really shitty lately and pizza is my soul animal.

Been sick for a week, wife is out of town, and just started wanted food again.
I've been crazy sick for a week (fever, cough, sore throat) and I just started feeling better, so I thought some nice greasy pizza is just what the doctor ordered. My wife is out of town with our car so my only mode of transportation is walking, and I've definitely not well enough for that.

Anyone care to sling a sick guy some pie?

MO] I would really appreciate a pizza, is all.
Alright, if any of you remember my last post a few months ago, I was in dire straits. Well, shit has shuffled and gone crazy, but I've managed to get employed and find a place to live! YAY!

the only downside to that is it left me broke. Like, my bank account is $0.00 broke. It's really a small negative considering all the positive that's happened to me here recently, but a pizza would really be appreciated nonetheless. I can return the favor on Payday (Friday, Jan 23, 2015). 

Thanks guys!

I'm all about helping people out but I want a chance to win a pizza even though I don't have 3 starving children that all have cancer. Like, I don't want to feel bad about trying to get the most joyous object in America and I don't want to make others feel bad so I can get a pizza.

Immediate edit: I have no problem with people asking for pizzas. I want to reiterate that. I just want to also have a chance at pizza.

I don't have a sob story. I'm worse off than some and better off then some. I like trees and will be enjoying them tonight. It would be nice to have some super ridiculously tasty pizza to enjoy with it. I love this sub and all the givers, even if I don't get anything. You (and kinky sex) make the world a better place.

Stuck at home because new job doesn't start for a couple weeks...
Got laid off my old job just in time to start my new one. However, when I went into the new office today, I was told that they had to move my start date into February. So for the next couple weeks, I've got nothing to do other than sit in my room and play xbox while quietly crying to myself. A pizza pie filled with awesomeness would be appreciated, and I'll dedicate the first slice to you!

2 students in their first month of commercial diving school, a pizza would really help make ends meet. We can absolutely pay it forward when we begin receiving our housing allowance from the GI Bill February 1st
Hey guys, thanks for reading even if you can't help. My buddy and I just started dive school this month. We are on a paper thin budget and any help will help us make ends meet this month. Like I said in the title, when we begin receiving our housing allowance from the GI Bill in February 1st we can and absolutely will pay it forward. 

Again, thanks for reading even if you aren't in a position to lend a hand!

i am completely broke (except for the 7 cents in my bank account) and have eaten what little food i had in the house. i have been unemployed since august and look for jobs every day but nothing yet. my car is gone, i have nothing left to sell, and i'm feeling especially down today. sorry for the sob story but the truth is that a pizza would make my whole week. i'm so hungry and i'm out of options. whether i get a pizza or not- one day i am going to have a job again and buy someone a pizza off this sub. i love the idea of strangers helping each other. it makes you feel less alone in the world.

No way of getting food
So I'm in a stupid situation. I lost my wallet two days ago which had my ID, my school ID, my debit card,etc. I need my school ID to get food on campus, which is how i normally get food. To get a new school ID, i need my driver's license. I went online to order a new driver's license, but I can't get a new one unless i go into the DMV in person. I live on the opposite end of the state, and won't be able to do so until the weekend. 
I also only have enough money for rent this month. 

So that's the story. It would mean a lot to me to have a full meal that i don't have to mooch off my friends and roommates. I feel bad continuing to take their food, despite their offering.

Thanks for reading!

Will write creative/humorous backstories for your RPG character for pizza.
I have had a dream to find a way to become a proffesional storyteller one day, and have fallen in love with Role Playing Games like Pathfinder and Dragon Age. I will concoct a brief, but detailed backstory for a character of yours in exchange for food for my roomate and I tonight. Btw, I live in Ohio, where orange construction barrels grow like weeds.

Broke College Senior, No Money for Dinner
Hello generous pizza giving people of reddit. I'm in need of dinner tonight in SYRACUSE, NY. My loans haven't come through for my food or my rent yet and the semester has started. I've had to use my private earnings to pay rent this month as well as for last weeks groceries and now I find myself with no money for food. I thought for sure that the university would have my refund check today but I was mistaken. Anyone want to help? I'm sure I could scrounge up some old Ramen if you all can't help, so if there is a more deserving member pick them over me. Thanks and have a good night everyone.

Could use a night out.
My car died last October, and naturally my social life has taken a pretty significant hit. I've even been reduced to a full online course load this semester. I'm a couple weeks out from my first unemployment check, but I could really stand for some socializing over a pizza. It seems mild compared to a lot of other posts round here, but I'm getting pretty stir crazy.

I'm more than content to pay it forward when given the chance.

Pizza Hut for tired/disabled family
I hate bothering you all nice people but I am at a loss for what to do.  I am disabled so I can only work part time.  My husband and I are property managers which ensures we get a roof over our head and enough money that we can pay bills.  There isn't any room in the budget for extras.  Mostly that is ok.  

One of the problems I am having to deal with is trouble sleeping.  It is to a severe point, and I am bad enough that I am hallucinating today.  My husband has been taking over for me on my part of the property management job and caring for our 2.75 year old autistic toddler.  He is worn out as well.  Luckily I talked to my doctor and I will be going back to some medication that helped me sleep at least a little bit but I can't take it until tonight.  I do not feel safe driving, my husband is busy with apartment work, and I do not think I could cook tonight.

So please,  anyone willing to get us a pizza to make it through tonight?  The only one nearby is Pizza Hut.  And while our bills are paid there just isn't any money that I can afford it ourselves.

Thank you for reading.

British world traveler who's very hungry and can't afford a good pizza, flying to Montreal tomorrow from Edmonton at 5am
Since I'm travelling on a budget, I have to spend my money very carefully, which means I haven't been able to splurge on good food in a long time. Mostly just lots of pasta and bread because it's cheap. Need some variety and eat something I actually enjoy, instead of just whats cheap. So, so hungry :(

Hungry and pretty darn broke
I've only gotten a grand total of 21 hours at work for the past two weeks and its been a real struggle to pay for bills and rent and insurance and food. I've had to make more than one sacrifice and default on a couple payments already. I'd greatly appreciate anyone willing to be my temporary fairy pizza-mother. Every little bit helps.

Too sick to cook, pizza would be awesome. Unrelated, anyone who comments will get a super special user flair in /r/RandomTrueFacts
So, here's the deal. Reddit prevents me from combining my desperation for pizza with my modding duties in the normal way: bribes of pure css. So instead, I'm asking for pizza and in a totally unrelated matter, comment in this thread telling me an awesome fact and you will get a custom flair in /r/RandomTrueFacts.

Warning: you may not like the flair you get

So my wife is away for the next 5 days, she left this morning. I went out and bought some beer, because I figured "Hey! Might as well drink!" And then I thought, oh Pizza would be nice! But I have no pizza. Just beer. If anybody would like to RAOP me, it would be muchly appreciated!

I will write any story in exchange for a good meal.
I like to think of myself as a writer in my free time, and have been writing fiction since I ran a D&amp;D campaign when I was a kid. I now write regularly over at /r/SubredditOfTheDay as well. I'm good with absurdity, and everything is fair game. In exchange for a pizza, I'll write whatever you wish in whatever format you'd like.

If you'd prefer a picture instead, I can draw some mean stick figures. I've got a pretty good (though monotone-ish) voice, so I could narrate something absurd as well. Don't think for a second I won't produce an audiobook of your erotic HarryPotter/PowerRangers fanfiction.

As for my situation: I'm currently eating once a day, which is once a day more than usual, since I found some food in a scenario I'd rather not go into detail on. Still, a night's meal of a couple carrots or an uncooked can of tuna on bread isn't very filling and much less appealing after the fourth or fifth night. I'd like some pizza, as it's my favorite food and it's been quite a long time since I've had the luxury of eating it.

I'm in a bit of a twist here with my living situation. I'm 26 on ssdi, and have started online schooling a couple classes, with little financial aid to cover anything I've ran out of my food stamps, because I have no transportation to grab major groceries with them-resorting in expensive convenience shopping... If one of you generous sirs/ladies would be so gracious as to help me out with something, I'd be more than happy to pizza-it-forward for the next fellow person who so needs sustenance in due time. Thank you for your generosity!

Back with more Pizza4Kiva! I'll immediately pay forward double the pizza cost to anyone on Kiva!
Hey guys. [Four months ago I gave this a shot](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/2g513v/request_tough_spot_and_really_hungry_will/), and it worked out really well. I got pizza and someone on Kiva got $50. [I tried it again two months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/2ka7f1/request_hungry_will_immediately_pay_forward/), and another generous soul contributed for me to lend out another $50. Much thanks to /u/PizzusChrist and the other user (who has since deleted their username).

If you don't know what Kiva is, check it out. Here's a link to my lender profile: http://www.kiva.org/lender/css (I added a section saying hi to Reddit as verification)

I've lent a bit over $1200 on Kiva so far. Here's a screenshot of my portfolio: http://puu.sh/eTv1R/a6a2c09604.png

No sad story for you guys. My situation has improved a lot since my first post here. I'm down to lend double the amount that anyone is willing to put my way in the form of a Domino's gift card to anyone. I've got a little over $50 in my Kiva account, so an amount of $25 or below would be ideal (but I'm not complaining if you offer more).

You can pick who I'll lend to: http://www.kiva.org/lend - I'll reply back with proof of the loan, and you'll see them appear in my user profile. I'll post it all here so everything is legit.

Thanks to anyone who gives this consideration!

To elaborate; I'm currently broke, and spend the last of my money on rent last week have $5 to my name and am currently in a job search, I've applied at 15 locations in the past week alone, (got an interview Weds) and in the time i haven't been glued to the computer or walking the city (boston) i've been working out again, and im trying to make the hunger go away for a couple more days( pizza is always a multi day/er) before i go back to whatever rice/pasta i haven't emptied my shelves of..making me a Hungry Hospitality Hunting Heman who wants help hiding his hunger.. Even if you can't help i hope the title made you laugh, took a few mins to brainstorm that one..

Broke and No Food [Canada]
Hey guys my parents are out of town for the weekend, and we are out of food. Was hoping some generous soul would help us out with a pizza to feed myself, my brother and sister as we have no money. I will definitely pay it forward when I can if somebody can help us out.

Hungry and would love pizza. :) [US]
So long story short: paycheck got lost in the mail and we are broke until the reissued one shows up. We have a Pizza Hut and a Little Caesars within walking distance of our place if someone would be so generous? Pizza Hut is offering $7.99 Large 2-topping carryout that can be ordered online. Just my fiance and I plus 2 furbabies, but the furbabies have food. :P Ludington, Michigan! Willing to pay-it-forward later..or??

Engineering Student Who Forgot Wallet and Lunchbox
Hey guys. I woke up late for a group meeting and while rushing out the door I forgot my wallet and lunchbox. The parking garage I use isn't free to leave until 10 pm tonight so I'm stuck on campus all day and it's gonna be a long one with no food. Could really use some help, and would appreciate more than you know. Thanks

No sob story here, just a crazy dude.
My team and I just participated in the 2015 global game jam. For those of you not familiar, it's a 48-hour competition where you have to make a game from scratch based on whatever theme they give you. This year's theme was "What do we do now?" Most of us stayed up an ungodly amount of hours to make sure our game was done. I've managed to sleep a whole 4 hours over the duration of the entire competition. Some of the team has gone back home, but I'm still here along with 2 other members. Right now, we're exhausted and some 'za would be pretty awesome. I originally promised to cook dinner for the team, but I'm pooped.

However, if there's someone who really needs it and you have a choice between giving to us or them, give the pizza to them. It'd just be nice to have.

Papa Johns just literally took my money and gave me 0 fucking pizza. Kinda losing my shit.
I just ordered a pizza with my last fucking money on my AM express card and it has my exes billing address which they won't let me change for some reason and I forgot and put my address. Somehow they were able to take my money but cannot possibly give it back regardless of calls. I have 1 bag of ramen left and am sort of having a mental  break down and crying because I was so happy to have been able to get a pizza. ._. 

If anyone wanted to help me with papajohns pizza I could cry in happiness. I already tried this a few times but not as desperately. Here's to hoping.

Forgot to get my milk, eggs, and bread before the snow.
So, here's the deal:

I'm a broke college student, Navy veteran,  and kinda light on groceries this week, and not only because the bank account is light. Ive got canned stuff, I've got some kraft mac and cheese, so I'm not a starvation case or anything. 

My problem is that I failed to get milk to make up my mac and cheese box for the night, and with the snow that never ends here in PA, my bullshit car isn't going to be going anywhere until tomorrow. 

So, if you can spare it, I could use a little help. I'll pizza it forward when the GI Bill money finally rolls in.

TIFU by cutting off a small chunk of my thumb.. Pizza would be cool.
I was in our kitchen at work cutting an apple up, someone walked in and startled me (I'm a jumpy person in general and have had one too many cups of coffee this morning) and BAM. Its not bad enough to warrant a trip to the ER, but just bad enough that I've been through several band aids already and have had to resort to office tape to due to lack of bandages. [3 band aids in.](http://i.imgur.com/DpdCElo.jpg)

I'm a stress eater, and pizza would just be cool. All my boyfriend said was "As long as your sexy feet are ok!". So even if I don't get pizza, thanks for sympathizing hah.

I need a pizza to use as a tissue for all of my tears
A stupid awful water pipe burst inside my wall this morning (last night maybe?). The water company came to shut it off, and I am cleaning up a swampy kitchen and laundry room (where I regrettably kept the cat litter box). We're flat broke until literally tomorrow, so this is incredibly bad timing. 

Since I'm going to be spending my day moving furniture and cleaning up water, moving food and dishes, etc, I would very much like to not have to worry about cooking. Anybody wanna make that happen for us? It's just me, my SO, and his small child who is making it his life goal to be a complete handful at the most inappropriate times.  Maybe a pizza will stifle my stress tears and raise morale around here.

Spent my last $80 on medicine and a doctor's visit, would love a pizza instead of eating chicken soup for the 3rd meal in a row!
The money I had budgeted for groceries this week had to be used for my doctor's visit and medicine for my severe upper respiratory infection. All I have left in the house is Chicken soup (which I've already eaten for 3 different meals), Oatmeal, and rice.

Pizza would be greatly appreciated!!

is fixed - but a lot of food went bad, and pay day is the 29th. :(
Our fridge went down recently and decided to kick the bucket, which normally in South Dakota wouldn't be an issue, in the middle of winter. Except it's been warming up abnormally much for January (it was 50 the other day!) which caused most of our staple foods to go bad in the time it took them to fix our fridge.

Needless to say, between the repair cost and the food going bad, we're in quite a pickle in the next two days, and with two kids (3 and 9) to feed that's bad. If anyone was willing to help us out we'd be very grateful!

Family of 4 needs another meal before the 1st, been a hell of a two-month period.
Hey reddit, hate to ask but shit is rough. Been out of work for allmost 2 months now due to a hernia, we went through our foodstamps way faster than normal( i guess me being home and kids getting days off) and now we are down to almost nothing. We have dinners for 3 nights but nothing else.  Anything would be appreciated, i think dominoes is the only place that will deliver here, and no car just a moped that I cannot currently ride.  

  I can provide nothing actual in return, i can write you a custom poem or something maybe?

I would love happy ending to a very long 24hrs.
Last night my daughter lost her beloved pet rat. We found him in his cage the night before, he was very lethargic. We believe it was just his time to go because of his age. We stayed up with him till he passed around 4am. Everyone is sad and exhausted. The kids would love it (of course) and my husband and I would appreciate the gesture. Thank you to anyone who reads this.

Can't afford to celebrate SO getting a new job
Hey there fellow redditor, my girlfriend left her job awhile back due to bad treatment, lack of hours and an overall bad job, and she's been without work for awhile. She's applied places and had interviews but at first none seemed to be promising. Then yesterday she had an interview at a call center and they hired her full time on the spot! Unfortunately, with only me working in fast food, we haven't been able to do anything nice together in some time. I know she loves pizza and it would be awesome for us to be able to celebrate. Thanks for your time!

Pizza please?
I don't really have a sad story besides spending my last bit of money on prepping my car for a road trip this weekend and I don't get paid until Thursday. A medium pepperoni pizza would be amazing to have for tonight/tomorrow's lunch and I will forward it on Thursday. Would someone please make my day? 

I'm from NC if needed.

Home sick from work today, haven't had a good pizza in a while but I'm unfortunately broke until I get my first paycheck from my new job (Feb 6th). I'm by no means poor... but a pizza on my "day off" would be amazing. If anyone's feeling up for it it would be greatly appreciated. :)

Will pay it forward February 6th :p

Had to talk with abusive ex's lawyer and mine today to describe, in detail, the altercation. Could really use a pizza to cheer me up.
So my soon to be ex husband was abusive, I finally had enough and filed charges.  He is facing time and I had to meet with his lawyer with mine to go over all the details of the last time together.  It was heart wrenching and have been kinda down.  Would love to be cheered up with a pie for me and my kiddos.  Thanks in advance!

SNAP won't be reloaded until next Monday. Help out?
Hi y'all!

Basically I've been sleeping in my car for several months from being unemployed but things are getting tougher for me as I am running out of personal things to sell to keep me afloat, especially in the meal department.  I literally have to choose to use my last few dollars on eating dinner or putting gas in my car.  

My food stamp (SNAP) is depleted as well - it's really a pain not having a kitchen to cook and store food in so things are more expensive when I have to buy ready-made cold sandwiches from the local grocers.

I "live" in FL, zip code 33611 so there's a Papa Johns and Domino's right around the corner from me.  If it would make it easier, there seems to be an electronic gift card for Papa Johns on Amazon as well.

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MV9GCYQ/gcrnsts?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=papa%20johns%20gift%20card&amp;qid=1422465959&amp;ref_=sr_1_2&amp;sr=8-2

Thanks guys. 

edit:  I did get a hook-up last week so I'm hoping I'm not stepping on some toes. If so, please let me know.

You feed me $25 worth of Domino's, I put $50 towards someone in need?
Hey guys. Four months ago I gave this a shot, and it worked out really well. I got pizza and someone on Kiva got $50. I tried it again two months ago, and another generous soul contributed for me to lend out another $50. Much thanks to /u/PizzusChrist and the other user (who has since deleted their username).

If you don't know what Kiva is, check it out. Here's a link to my lender profile: http://www.kiva.org/lender/css (I added a section saying hi to Reddit as verification)

I've lent a bit over $1200 on Kiva so far. Here's a screenshot of my portfolio: http://puu.sh/eTv1R/a6a2c09604.png

No sad story for you guys. My situation has improved a lot since my first post here. I'm down to lend double the amount that anyone is willing to put my way in the form of a Domino's gift card to anyone. I've got a little over $50 in my Kiva account, so an amount of $25 or below would be ideal (but I'm not complaining if you offer more).

You can pick who I'll lend to: http://www.kiva.org/lend - I'll reply back with proof of the loan, and you'll see them appear in my user profile. I'll post it all here so everything is legit.

Thanks to anyone who gives this consideration!

Michigan USA. Worst week of our life a few months into marriage. Wouldn't mind one evening of peace with the husband.
Long story short, I found out that the office is conducting layoffs and I'm not sure on the status of my job for much longer. Same week, husband's car seized up and we had to find a new one (signed papers today), but had to deal with one car for the week for both jobs. Then my car started smoking and had a couple hundred dollars worth of repairs. We are doing what we can to make dinners with what we have left, but pizza would put a smile on our faces for the evening.

The good news? We signed another car today so that problem is solved. My car is finally fixed and we both are interviewing for second jobs to help out to pay for the new car.

I could use a friend and some food right now
A bunch of things have all together to make me feel pretty crappy. I have been at my school for 2 years yet I only have acquaintances who are always "busy" when I ask them to hang out. I even offered one of my acquaintances money to "tutor" me aka sit with me while I work so I can't procrastinate but she was always busy for 2 weeks so I stopped asking. I just turned 18 on the 20th and I had a sinus infection and my hardest finals the day after so I had to study until 12:30 while making a mountain of snotty tissues. I think a pasta bread bowl from dominos would be really nice. If a pasta bread bowl is against the rules a pizza works just as well. If you want I would love to pay you back in a skype voice call to just chat about stuff. I'm 18 and I live in San Diego, California. If you have any questions feel free to comment or private message me.

long day. Fiance and I could use a pick me up.
I'll sum it up quick. Sitting at the doctors office with my SO. She's having problems with anxiety and her chest feeling like she can't breathe, work related harassment(not sexual, verbal abuse, mind games etc.) I'm out of work for a few days with a messed up back. (I've had these issues my entire life, nothing I can fix, just live with it.) Needless to say we won't have time to cook tonight and with her probably losing her job and rent due on the first we could use a pickme up. We are in MI, hungry Howie's, jets, dominos and little ceasers near us.

Quit job to stay in school, money is a little tight (Los Angeles)
Due to some health concerns I had to quit my job so I could stay in school and not have to move back to my home state. I'm waiting for some money to move around in the bank and I'm strapped for cash food wise for the next few days... :( this is a great subreddit and I plan to pay it forward when I get some more money in the bank!

Rough Few Weeks
My husband and I both work semi-seasonal jobs.  There is a lot of work in the spring, summer, and fall, but in the winter it is a ghost town.  We are lucky to combined get 30 hours a week.  I decided I didn't want to be broke again this winter so I took a class in the fall so I would be able to get a part time job in the winter.  Because of this class though all fall I had to limit my hours.  


I did get the job and started the first of this year, however my hiring paper got screwed up so my "hire date" was actually 1/16 on the paperwork.  Because of this I only had 8 hours on my first paycheck because my boss didn't get the information of the actual hours I had worked to the right person in time.  Also because of this I did not have time to sign up for direct deposit for my first paycheck, so it had to be mailed to me.  It should have arrived last friday (the 24th), but they had the wrong address.  I can not call and get it resent until tomorrow.  Its all just a mess.


So basically, I am working 2 jobs, 6-7 days a week. My husband is working 1 job 1-2 days a week.  And we still only have $10 in the bank account.  We have one car, my mother-in-law has helped us a little buying groceries but they have run out for now.  He gets paid tomorrow but it won't be much. 


I can buy for someone when I get my paycheck next friday (My pay + all the pay I have missed) but for now a pizza and breadsticks would be so nice.  There is domino's near by and papa johns.  


PM me and I can send as much proof as I can provide. We live in GA by the way.


Thanks anyone who can help!

Hey /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza,

I'm the only one in my apartment tonight and most of my friends are going to be out at a Chinese buffet while I'm stuck at the apartment tonight with only left-overs. Anyone willing to help me out with even a small cheese pizza would be great!

Got diagnosed with my second chronic illness and told I had to eat gluten free in the same week. All I want is one last 'normal' pizza.
I got diagnosed with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome after 10 years of not know what was wrong I guess its nice to know but the gluten free thing is really raining on my parade. I also found out in the same week that I can no longer eat meat, my first favorite thing in the world. (insert phallic joke here) I am not sure how to survive without bacon so I am not having fun lol I LOVE pizza, good Italian bread, cinnamon rolls, bagels, waffles and basically everything with gluten in it go figure lol. I've tried out a few gluten free options and they all taste like cardboard and were a waste of my grocery money this week. I'm not celiac so it doesn't damage my intestines it just causes pain. But I think that one last pizza is worth it. I'm only 22 and at least 40 years without regular pizza is going to be tough.

Spent my last two dollars on a loaf of bread and ramen, two days ago. The last 74 cents in my account used for gas to get me home. Tomorrow is payday, but I sure could use a pizza before then.

Interested In Starting A "Pizza It Forward" Using Papa John's Super Bowl Free Pizza Deal
If you are planning on ordering pizza from Pappa John's now through Super Bowl Sunday, Feb 2, 2015. Consider ordering online and use the promo code to get a free pizza with 3 toppings.  Here are the details http://www.papajohns.com/pjmvp/  You can then redeem the free pizza for yourself or pay it forward to order for someone else from Monday, Feb 3rd to Feb 23rd.  I need some help organizing this thread between offers and requests, so if you leave a comment, let us know with a R or an O.  (Example:  O, got my free Super Bowl pizza deal ready to use.....R, money's tight, I'll PM you delivery address).  I think this could be a great help to others...and...free pizza, please check it out.  http://www.papajohns.com/pjmvp/

Starting job on Monday and have no more food left in my house... Pizza would be nice again :\
Posted I think 6 or 7 days ago and a wonderful Redditor helped me out and got me some pizza.  I still intend to return the favor when I start receiving an income again but as of right now I'm pretty damn hungry and pizza sounds delicious.

[MA] Home alone, would love a pizza instead of beans and peanut butter!
Currently home alone with no way to get real food while parents enjoy a steak dinner in Florida. Meanwhile, I can't drive or walk to anywhere right now due to no car and too much snow. I'm left with basically enough to make a bowl of Baked Beans with Peanut Butter on top (don't even have bread...). After a week of not being able to leave the house, I'm craving a pizza. Anyone care to help?

EDIT: Ended up caving since it's been almost two hours, would not recommend putting Peanut Butter in your Baked beans. I don't know how to change it so this no longer shows since I ate something, but it's no big (I mean, if someone still wants to send me a pizza, I'll take it!)

Son's first winter scout camp. Could use a pie to take my mind off it.

Hey all.  This is my son's first winter camp with his Wolf Cub pack, and of course there's a nor'easter coming in with heavy snow, wind and freezing rain.  They didn't call it off since everything was bought so needless to say, I honoured his choice and let him go.  

I'm just worried for him, I know the leaders are experienced campers and whatnot, but still, the mother hen is strong in me.  lol.

So yeah a pie would be a great way to help me stop my worrying...at least temporarily.  I live in Nova Scotia Canada and there's Pizzadelight.com with online ordering, and there's a local place called Mimis that are pretty good too.
(NOTE The reason why I deleted my first post was because I forgot the Tag for Request and it wouldn't let me edit the topic)

Sick with the flu, would love some comfort food!
First off: I've received before so keep that in mind if it's something you look out for when giving. 

Money is really tight (as it has been for a very long time for me) and I'm sitting here in my apartment with the worst flu I've probably ever had at it's peak currently. Somehow my appetite is still here so I would absolutely love some pizza!! As I'm basically bedridden, I cannot do any carryout orders so if it were to be a GC, it would have to be Domino's or Papa John's so I could tip the driver.

Thanks for any consideration! Also, any helpful home remedies or ways to feel better from this god awful flu would be more than appreciated

no sob story here, just blew my money in vegas.
I turned 30 on Saturday (yay! Old lady!) and celebrated with 5 fabulous days in Las Vegas. It was my first time there. I paid my bills before I went, because I like to pretend to be responsible. After 3 days of far far too many free rum and cokes I rather conveniently forgot several important money things. Like that parking was going to be $80 at the airport and I need to renew my car registration and I had to travel for work on Wed-fri (flew home Tuesday) which I won't get reimbursed for until next week. 

So just got back from 3 hours driving from my work training and like a battle worn ninja turtle, I am craving the cheesy goodness of pizza. I have given pizza here before and have every intention of doing so again (because everyone needs a bit of a pizza sometimes). I have nothing to offer in return today except my sincere gratitude and $4 for the driver. 

Ps: if you visit vegas Evil Dead: The Musical and Absinthe are the most hilarious shows ever.

Home alone and down with the flu. A pizza would make my entire life right about now.
Hey, guys. Like I said, I'm home alone tonight and have been dealing with the flu for a couple of days now. I don't have much of anything to eat at home and payday is still a ways away, so if someone would be willing to send a broke sick girl a pepperoni pizza, it would be greatly appreciated and I'll definitely return the favor when I get paid. &lt;3

for pizza in all the wrong places
I'm a 23 year old male living in the mormon state. I like long walks to the fridge and pizza. My friend was going to stop by my house in layton with some pizza but he flaked out leaving me pizza-less. After that heartbreak I wasn't sure if I could ever pizza again, but I decided to throw my hat into the ring and try out the pizza game one more time. Nothing long term, just a casual pizza here and there.
Serious inquiries only please. ;)

Got scammed out of a meal a few days ago. Would like a pie for dinner tonight please.
I forgot my location and to tag it as a request in my last post. Whoops. It's tagged here and I live in Central Florida. I got scammed out of a meal last week unfortunately(not from the person offering to get me pizza, but from someone taking advantage of his kindness). Got paid last week but recently ran into car trouble and had to fix the problem immediately. I have no money for food for the next two days. A pizza would solve that problem. If anyone is feeling generous please let me know. Also, PM ME. Don't respond to anyone that PM's you if it looks like my name. I just don't want people to get scammed at my expense again. Thanks again!

(AZ) Starving couple need some pizza! (Long story)
Hello, this is my third attempt at requesting some pizza, and hoping that some nice, wonderful person would be kind enough to send us a pie. We're very nice people and I hate to admit but the past year we've been stealing food from supermarkets etc, not because its fun, or because we're lazy, trust me, I've had my fair share of jobs and working my ass off just to go nowhere in life, but because no matter how hard you work your still behind. I know what your thinking "Why don't you look for a better job? One that pays more?" Well to answer that, and its very embarrassing to say, but I can't get a higher then min paying job, well because I don't have an education that requires such job. The reason is my parents were into this thing called Homeschooling? Unschooling? And very religious, like "bible in your face, don't question anything we tell you" kind of religious. Don't get me wrong, a lot of religious people are nice, a lot of homeschooling/unschooling parents are nice too, I'm not against any of that, I just want to share why I'm struggling so hard at 21. Anyway, I was born a girl (big mistake) so me wanting to learn was against what they believed, I was taught to read and write by a friend of mine, I still struggle with basic math, and some other things as well. I grew up in a very dysfunctional home, dad was always gone, mom was very abusive and put the responsibilities of motherhood (cleaning, cooking, watching my younger siblings) on my shoulders. My parents were so scared we would be taken away because of the abuse that they moved us up into the woods, miles away from anybody, without running water, without food, and left us there, I remember using the bathroom out in the woods because the toilet didn't work. I remember eating expired cans of beans, that smelled like so awful, you would have thought a corpse was hidden in the walls of our trailer. The dishes were washed using water that was hauled from a stream a few miles down the road. I couldn't have been nine at the time but my mother had me reuse the same water over and over for the dishes and it would get milky, yellow, grossness. I was once done with the dishes and remember telling her they weren't clean enough and that we needed fresh water, she told me to suck it up and wash them with that water anyways, so I did, I went outside to check on my younger siblings (8 and 7 at the time) she comes running out and throws a cup at my head and screams at me for being a "Lazy whore."
There's more, countless hair pulling, being woken up in the middle of the night to clean, being threatened with death or being kicked out, but I'm not going into all of that right now









*Fast forward to my teens*




We moved to a town and I was maybe 12? 13? At the time, my mom faked my age and name to get me a full time job at a motel as a housekeeper, my parents were fighting a lot more then usual so they decided to punish each other by not working and sleeping around, leaving the rent, and other bills up to me. I never saw a paycheck because my parents would take them then gamble away the money, my mom started seeing a guy, I'll call him "Frodo" because Frodos a bitch and so is this guy. My mother kicked my dad out and brought Frodo in, like the same day, and told us (me and my siblings) that he was our new daddy and to "Get the fuck over it." My youngest sister had was sick at the time but my mom ignored it in favor of her new fuck buddy, so the months I stayed awake with my sister while she couldn't breath then the next day went to work just to come home and clean after my mom and her BFs after party mess, was really getting to me. Growing up, I wasn't allowed to show emotions, show when I was upset, or happy, i had to be a robot, cold, heartless robot. So I didn't know what depression felt like until I was in my late teens. You really don't know how this stuff impacts your life until you've been away for awhile and see it through others eyes. Sometimes I even question myself on whether or not I was abused, but then I look back and remember being screamed at for not having the house spotless or for being sick when I had to work, its stuff like that, that keeps me from trying to justify their actions. I was a good kid, I mean, I worked, I took care of my siblings and I never got introuble with the police, but somehow my mom, or dad, would accuse me of sleeping around at work, stealing, doing drugs, drinking, I went to youth group atleast twice a month, I went to church whenever i could, yet at home I was accused of so many things, I thought I was bad, so I stopped doing anything that was fun and just kept working, home, repeat.



*Fast forward to seventeen*

At seventeen I left, not because I wanted to, but because my younger brother tried to kill me in the kitchen, he was taking martial art classes, (thanks to me) and I had another job babysitting, so extra cash, meant extra food, and my younger siblings could be kids and go to summer camp, theme parks, take classes like the one I described up above. I came home from supermarket with FOOD! Sweet sweet food, I put them away and told my younger brother "Theres food in the fridge, if your hungry I'll make something" Now I don't know what was wrong with him, I'm guessing he has severe mental issues from being born premature and being knocked in the head a few times, but he freaked out and attacked me, started choking me and wouldn't let up, so I hit him in the head with a pan, and ran out, never looking back. Of course my mother calls and screams at me "You hurt your little brother, you fucking cunt! I'm going to fucking get you" Etc. After that I couch hoped for two years, I lost my job at the motel and was homeless and jobless. At 19 I met my husband, we were dating a few months when my mother called me up and said "We have no food, can you help? Your daddy left us (her and my younger siblings) without money etc" So I pawned whatever I had to get them some food, when I get there, SUPRISE, SURPRISE! They have an XBOX360, two flat screens and brand new smart phones! I didnt get one thank you, not one!


*Moving to AZ*
So my husband and I decided to move to AZ and when my mother found out she flipped, she called and threatened me, threatened him, blah, blah. We left anyways, my birthday comes around and I got a hate email from my sister, a nasty call from Frodo saying how much I've ruined their lives etc, then my mother calls the police, and well that sums up the back story. 




Ive tried getting my GED, I've tried studying, but I do not understand it all, I wish I could have gone to school, to college, become something, but thats never going to happen, I know it, you probably know it. I know this was a long long story just for pizza, but I thought the person who decided to help us atleast deserved to know why we are struggling so much, and yes I have asked for help from my mom but she refused. So there ya have it. Thanks for reading

Job cut my hours, no money and hungry
I've been a cook for a few years now and got a decent (!!) job at a local pizza place. However,  business has been terrible and rather than firing employees they've been giving everyone a shift a week for the past two months. Being one of the few cooks with actual experience, I thought this might blow over, however, I'm pretty sure I basically don't' have a job right now and am wondering how to pay rent and feed myself. My friend told me to try this reddit out and I figured I had few options left, so why not. Help a poor, starving cook out if you want, reddit.

Sick and hungry

I just started classes on the 16th and am still waiting on my student loans to come in. My fiancé got paid this week but bills came in we weren't planning on and we are flat broke now. To make matters worse, I woke up this morning with the beginnings of a hellacious ear infection. A hot dominos pizza would be super swanky swell guys!

Seahawks fan, in need of consolation/celebration pizza
Look. I'll level with you. Being a lifelong Seahawks fan has been rough, *especially* these last few weeks. Come Sunday, I'll be in need of delicious pizza to gorge myself on in celebration of our inevitable victory/to cry tears into because we lost.  
  
Also, I'm living in Albuquerque, which means nothing but Broncos fans and Cowboys fans for miles. D:

Skint uni student, with no food or company. (UK)
I've got no money left and very little food as I'm currently unemployed and my student loan hasn't came in yet. To make my situation that much worse all of my friends and flatmates are either away or are going out tonight and I can't join or drink with them since I'm so skint. Any pizza will be greatly appreciated as I've only got a few packets of super noodles left to do me till the end of next week.

Last attempt didn't pan out, figured I'd give it another shot.
About a week ago, I posted a request that was replied to fairly quickly, but then all communication stopped almost immediately. I'm hoping tonight works out a little better, so I don't have to cook what little is left in the house, and I'm able to feed myself and my parents without worrying. I'm in Washington, and Domino's and Pizza Hut are both close by.

I should be able to return the favor/pay it forward within the week, but for now, if it's not pizza, it's gonna be rice and... Well, more rice.

about $10 left in bank account, no food left in house and no money until Tuesday
I recently moved in with a friend and his Dad, as my friend recently lost his Mom to Leukemia and they were going to have to move out of their home if they didn't get a roommate to help with bills. Things were going fine until recently, when my girlfriend lost her job. Money has been really tight, and even tighter since I have had bronchitis earlier this month, and had to stay home from work for a few days without pay.
Papa John's is preferred, as they are the only ones that deliver to our address. We do have a Pizza Hut, but I would have to pick it up, and my gas tank is low. I should be fine financially soon, as my next paycheck includes overtime, but a biweekly paycheck makes things tough.

Pizza for hungry, overworked call center agent (Tacoma, WA)
My boyfriend and I have been struggling to catch up on the monstrous amount of debt from my relocation to WA plus a previous marriage and student loans. I'm trying to switch to full time soon, instead of part time, but I won't know until the 16th of March. We're down to spaghetti noodles and rice in the pantry until payday on the 6th. Pizza would be amazing for him to come home to after working his night shift. There are plenty of places around (Papa John's, Dominos, etc) and we don't have a preference except the deliciousness that is pineapple pepperoni.

When I was living in SC I actually ordered pizza for him when he was in WA before I knew about this reddit. Would be nice if karma paid it forward. &lt;3

Simple as put, I take care of my little sister and we're living paycheck to paycheck. I know she's tired of pasta at this point of the week but until tomorrow it's the menu. Food shopping will be better this month but it would be nice to surprise her with a pizza today. Figured it's worth a shot.

My boyfriend and I are sitting around hungry. We've had a pretty stressful last month and it would be nice to have a treat  and just be able to not worry about anything today. Papa John's has a deal where you can get a 5 topping pizza for 9.99 (like 13 with tax and delivery fee).

Like the title says we just moved here and will be watching our beloved Hawks defend their Superbowl title on a tiny laptop screen with not a hot-wing or chip bowl in sight. I feel like we could really use the Pizza to help make our little depressing Superbowl party for two a little better! Help us out?

Not a whole lot of food in the house, trying to save money. Kind of sick of leftovers. Finally have a night that I don't have to work, would like to relax with a pizza.
Located in Alabama. Just me and the cat tonight. Enjoying a night off from working, but a pizza would make it nicer. Low on funds at the moment, but I would be happy to pay it forward when it becomes feasible.

on rent and don't wanna "waste" what money I have on buying food.
So I moved into my new room two weeks ago, and had those two weeks to save up the $550 for rent I needed. Weeellll work wasn't very kind to me last week; I went home without taking any tables last Wednesday, made $40 as a food runner on Thursday, then $6 on Friday. This week was much better and I'm at about $430 wooo! But, I'm off today and hungry. I will go to the store and buy food if I have to, but I'd rather not take a few steps back on my savings since i have to pay my storage unit this weekend, which is $160. &gt;.&lt; I'll shout your kindness from the tops of the tallest mountains in Miami! :D Also it's just me I need to feed. My roommates handle themselves sooo you only need to feed a wittle waitress! :D

Tight budget, girlfriend having a bad day at work.
She's feeling down but knows we're on a tight budget for our bills the next two months. She mentioned wanting a pizza and I figured I'd see what I could do for her here. If you can help, great! If not, I understand that too obviously. And it would of course get paid forward likely in the form of a random act of pizza in the future for someone else.

Anyone able to help me send my bestfriend a pizza who is in the hospital?
Okay so my bestfriend's son is in the hospital and she's been up all day worried about him. She hasn't had the time to eat anything at all because she's been too stressed out. The surgery was successful and now I want her to eat, problem is the cafeteria is closing in an hour. So I was curious if someone would be able to help me send her a pizza =), I've tried to get a pizza for myself from here in the past and I've never been able to, but this time I want to get it for her. So if someone could help me do this for her, I'd be really grateful and appreciative. ^_^

lost part time job, don't get paid till Friday and battling my brain chemistry. A pizza would be magical. Story in comments.
I am currently battling some crazy  extreme depression/anxiety that is making taking care of business nearly impossible. Adding poor diet to the mix is not helping! I am hoping that a semi-random act of kindness could restore a little of my nutritional needs and faith in humanity. I am willing to trade some pics and/or bad haikus for pizza. 

I really need to get going... but can't tell if it's my brain chemistry, oatmeal only diet, or lack of motivation that's to blame. I suspect that the 1st 2 effect the latter. There's more to the story that I can divulge in a more private medium.

Disclosure: I have requested, but never recieved a pizza.

Broke, hungry, and unemployed grad student, trying this again.
I posted a few days ago to no avail, but I'm gonna try again. I'm a grad student at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, and like the title says I'm broke, hungry, and unemployed. I'm waiting for my financial aid to come in, but unfortunately my tribe (I'm Native American) is pretty bad about getting anything done fast, especially when it comes to money. So now I'm behind on my rent too, yay! Haven't eaten in about 5 days and I'm starting to get pretty hungry. Anyone care to give a fella a hand?

My identity was stolen, I have an eviction notice due up on Thursday, and my wife is 8 months pregnant and just wants some 'zza.
My family has just moved to a new place a few months ago, and we're trying to adjust to life here as best as we can. It's difficult however when I have a shit job, no money for rent, electric and a phone bill, and everything seems like it's just falling apart. Then I get stuck with an eviction notice for $900 due on Thursday, *THEN* look at my bank statement and see that I have $100 missing from my account, taken by some weird fax service I've never heard of, much less used, **THEN** I realize, even though I have *just* enough to order a sangwich and cheesy bread from domino's, I can't due to the fact that my card was canceled, so I cant do shit with the couple dollars in my bank. I'm asking for pizza, yes, but if anyone has an **idea** to help me out of my pizza situation, at least i can sleep with a full stomach, if nothing else. Please please please RAoP, show me the way! Or if you can't provide that, at least show me a small pizza for my 8 months pregnant wife and I. (Cheesy bread and a sangwich also work, but beggars can't be choosers.) I forgot earlier, but there's an update! I should be getting my tax refund back within a week or two! I think I can work things out with my landlord if I let her know all the info soon enough, and if anyone is kind enough to find me a pizza tonight, I can definitely pay you back, or pass along the giving very soon. Be my savior of the night RAoP! Help me celebrate! :)

(UK) - Totally skint, in debt, not eaten properly for 2 days. I'd appreciate anything.
Hi, I've been having trouble with my bank and rent changes, so much so it's left me with no money. I've pretty much eaten everything in my cupboards and now I've got no money for a few more days until I get myself back in balance. I've hardly eaten anything sustainable for  2-3 day now, just the last tins of soup and small snacks and now I'm running out. I'd be more than grateful if someone could send me a small pizza or something? I'll even pay it forward when I get myself back on my feet. Any help will be most welcome!

Not much in my bank account, roughly $3 in my wallet. Would like to save what little money I have if possible. I work two jobs, but paydays are few and far between. Near pizza places include Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa John's, and Marcos.

Snowed in for the second time this month!
I live in Nebraska, in the state capitol of Lincoln. Last week, it snowed so much, so quickly, that literally the entire city shut down. Today, its doing it again. My car is completely snowed in, and I'm not going anywhere today. There is a pizza place just a few minutes from my house that I would love to have a tasty pie from.....I can't buy my own because I've missed work twice in 7 days because of this snow.

Looking To Get My 5yr Old A Pizza For His Hard Work! (Shippensburg, PA)
So my 5yr old son has been wanting to make YouTube videos because he see's me making them. Well yesterday I decided to let him make one. He did a great job and he became very popular with the Destiny Community and now they want more. So I am hoping that someone would be willing to get him a pizza today. We are on a super tight budget which is why I can't afford to do it. Here is his video if you would like to watch it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxxkPvzqUhw

Home with a sick kid, would love a pie!!
So, I was told by my daycare that I can't bring my son until his cold has cleared up. There's a bad but of croup going around the local daycares, so my babysitter is being overly cautious with the kids. Since I had to take off work to stay with my son, I won't be making any money today. 

My son is 3, and is just a huge ball of energy. He absolutely loves pizza, and I'd like to treat him since he got to finally spend a whole day with just mommy. I'm on mobile, but I can post a pic of my monster if there's a demand for it. 

In return, I will pay it forward next Friday when I get paid. Thanks you guys!!

Tried last week with no sob story but I have one now.
I live in half of a duplex and my landlord and I share the bills for tv and Internet. I came home yesterday after work and sat down with some ice cream I bought at the store. I have a really bad peanut allergy and in my tired trudge through the store I grabbed some ice cream that had peanuts in it and didn't even notice until the first bite. So I start going into an allergic reaction and I think "I'll watch tv". Low and behold it doesn't work. Says it is shut off from an outstanding bill. I figure I might as well just watch Netflix and when I go to use the Internet it says it has been shut off due to an outstanding bill. So all I can do is sit in silence while I slowly make it through my throat swelling up. Could use some comfort food that isn't going to kill me until this situation settles itself.
Inb4 yes I paid my rent and my part of the bills.
TL;DR landlord handles my Internet and tv bill and didn't pay it even though I paid for it. on top of that I had a pretty bad allergic reaction.

my yearly "i'm down and out and need food" plea
You guys have helped me before and it was literally the best feeling in my last time of need. I moved to NYC two months ago to see if I can make something of myself beyond what my sleepy midwestern city (omaha) could offer me (hasn't happened yet) and I have now completely run out of food options. I'm 80 cents away from a bag of Utz chips, haha. I love New York City but it is pretty difficult to master. I just started working at a restaurant so the family meal they prepare for staff should start helping me out more but I don't work again until thursday and who knows when I get paid. ): but (: also.

I have been unemployed for six weeks. I had just enough to pay bills this month. Life is getting better though. The good news is that I just got a new job, but I won't be getting paid until the first. I know that my story isn't really that rough but I would love some pizza to celebrate my new job.

Bills are paid, but I'm interviewing for a new job, and so tired of eating ramen noodles and rice. Tired of watching my husband donate blood plasma to help us scrape by right now. Would be deeply appreciated and eventually reciprocated to go to sleep with a tummy full of delicious pizza. Please help us. Thank you!

Anyone wanna buy me some pizza? Just started my new job and get my first check tomorrow. Will repay in creativity as well as buying someone pizza in the future!
Hey everyone! Like the title says I just started my new job this week but until I get my first check (which is tomorrow I believe) I'm broke and don't have any food. Even then my first check is only 16 hrs because I had 2 days of training AND I have to buy diapers and such. I can make you something out of clay (I was thinking maybe a custom Snoo? Or whatever character you'd like...) Either way thanks in advance and Thanks for this subreddit. You guys really help people in need and thats awesome! I gotta work tonight 12-9.

Will draw a left handed chicken left handed in MS Paint for a BBQ chicken pizza (back after a technicality)
So, no thanks to the local utility company digging up my yard for a broken water line a couple days ago shortly after my post (it's still broken...no water here still), I lost internet and couldn't properly respond to the two people that responded to my request. So, here I am again, still hungry and tired of eating around my family's strange diet. I'm asking for a BBQ chicken pizza and will exchange an entertaining and terribly drawn MS Paint picture done entirely left handed. If you'd like, I'll do it on the laptop's touch pad just to make it more interesting and terrible!

I don't want to admit it... but my family is poor
Long story short, my dad lost his job. My mom can't work because my two sister's are young and one has severe dyslexia.. she *has* to be home-schooled.

We have been scraping by this last year or two, but things have gotten rough. 

Haven't been grocery shopping in weeks and nothing but frozen bananas.

A pizza for dinner would be great... 

Thanks!

Girl coming over, limited funds, pizza would help
What's up you guys,

So I met this really awesome girl two weeks ago while waiting for my pizza in Domino's. We talked for a while, really hitting it off, and eventually exchanged numbers.
Well now today is the first time she is coming over and I have no money... And I thought what better food to eat than the one that brought us together?

I love Pizza.

draw for pizza
Not going into work tonight, would like some pizza, I don't want something for nothing, so I am offering my drawing talent for a pizza and possibly a cold soda? 

I can draw anime and mlp style, but am willing to try anything that isn't realism or abstract(or mech/robots).

Being excluded by my new roommate
I'm in alone for the night, as my new roommate(I'm a new freshman this semester) has left me to go to a fraternity party with all of his friends. I go to a small town college where there aren't many social hangouts, so I'm in for the night. Could someone be so kind as to spare a pizza? I'd really appreciate it!

Spent last amount of cash on rent, super stressed.
I just got a new job after being without one for a couple of weeks, and had to use the last of my paycheck from my old job for rent this month. Just recently had to give away my dog since I couldn't afford the pet fee from the complex. Roommates don't want to help me out since they want as much money to spend on weed as possible, so I'm just in a rough spot. If anyone would be kind enough to help me out I promise to pay it back in the future when I'm more financially stable, thanks!

Not sure how this works but I'd love a pizza
A friend pointed me to this sub, which I think is a really awesome idea, after I was telling him about how broke I was and getting tired of hot dogs cut up in mac and cheese.  I'm pretty broke for the next few days and working out how to take the bus in each day, which is a priority over food (even though I'm pretty sure I'm getting laid off soon, again, second time in a year).  A pizza would be really nice.

And since I love the idea of this sub so much I'm subscribing and once things get back on track I can hopefully return the favor to someone else someday soon.

My friends are offering to smoke me out for finishing my LSAT, but I have quit smoking for 103 days so far, and I'd love to keep it that way. A pizza would be a good way for me to unwind without breaking my streak.

Hey everybody, my name is Jeremy. Im 19 years old, and from Jacksonville, FL. Found this subreddit after looking to see if I could find some free coupon codes online. Right now I work for The Boys and Girls club as a mentor, which covers my bills, aside from food, but I've got food stamps for that. Its near the end of the month though, and im out of cash. If anyone wants to send me a pizza, thatd be great.

$8 in my savings and checking account combined. Would really appreciate some help.
I work for a startup tech company in the northeast. We have our ups and downs, but have had a lot of downs recently, and the money isn't as steady right now. I am a manager, so I forgo pay checks so the employees can get paid and are still productive.  I haven't been paid in over a month, and both my bank account and stomach are feeling the consequences. 

I am so willing to pay it forward when I have the opportunity to do so.

going through divorce, have five dollars until Tuesday, haven't eaten since Thursday.
Hey RAOP, I'm going through a pretty bad patch of things now, I haven't been able to eat since Thursday due to either not having the time or money, and being so stressed out that I threw up the nutter butter that was my lunch Friday.

I have $5 to cover gas to get me to work and back the next two days, and life is just kicking my ass right now. I just want to be able to have some lunch at work today and maybe not feel as shitty.

Ontario - I came out to my dad as trans recently and it didn't go well. Dealing with that as well as a whopping $4 to last my family of three until Friday. A pizza would really lighten the mood around here
About four months ago I finally came to terms with being a transman and decided to come out to family members.  The reactions have been mixed, but the one person I thought would be supportive completely shut me down, doesn't take it seriously and just told me that I was gender confused because my mom "fucked me up emotionally" growing up.
On top of that, both paychecks this month were much less than anticipated, and we now have $4 to last my partner, my two year old and I until Friday, with pretty much no food left except Chef Boyardee and a can of soup.
We'd really appreciate even the smallest pizza right now.

EDIT: Don't know why I still have the got pizza'd flair, the last time that happened was over a year ago, sorry.

Wife and I are hungry with $1 in bank account. I'm sick and get paid in a week.
Hello everyone,

My wife and I are hungry since we're trying so hard to make everything last that we have until I get paid next week.  It would be absolutely great if anyone could help us out.

I've just today contracted strep throat (on a Sunday so have to wait until Monday for a doctor visit unfortunately), so any pizza place that has ice cream on their menu to freeze Mt burning throat would be a God send.

Anyways, thank you all for reading.  I greatly appreciate it!

I have a dominos and papa johns nearby. If I get pizza'd I'll pizza back at the end of February.

Impending homelessness + starvation = depression, anyone cheer me up?
Haven't had a bite to eat in days, the court decided to throw me out of my moms house to pay for her estate, could really use a pizza as a pick-me-up if anyone is so kind. I can promise to pay it forward in the future when my life turns around, but I can't promise a timeframe.

Can post picture of the court letter upon request if needed. Pizza Hut and Papa Johns are near enough to deliver.

The Noid destroyed my pizza. I need another for the Grammys! Help!
So as the title suggests, I was walking home from Dominos and the Noid zoomed in on a space bike...threw my pizza on the ground and walked all over it. He looked at me and laughed as he stomped the cheese and sauce into the ground.  Well, I had to walk back to the Grammys party I was hosting empty handed.  Everyone yelled out 'where's the za?'and I immediately broke down and cried. I'm locked out of my own apartment now, and the only way I can gain entry is if I have another pizza to share. And I already called the cops, but the automatic message said "the cops are all at home with their families eating pizza and getting ready for the Grammys," so basically I'm screwed. Thanks.

come on guys, show me some love. I could use a pizza to share with my family tonight.
I'm having a shitty week. I get that a lot of people on this sub have it rough (both requesters and gifters!) and I'm really not a special snowflakes but I just think what goes on here is really cool. It cheers me a little to see everyone connecting and helping each other out. I've been feeling hole in the soul blue lately, I could use a connection however slight or silly. My life is filled with people I help and give to but I often don't get much back. It can be lonely. I give myself freely and without expectation, so it's not that I'm quite complaining. I'm my grandparents caretaker, my best friends nanny, my disabled ex husbands helper.... I feel more like an employee some days than a loved one. But I love these people with all my heart so I get up every day and play mom, cook, clean, drive and try to hold it all together. I try to make time for self care but a toddler and two wacky senior citizens are time consuming. The ex is mostly wallet consuming. To top all that off, I've been sick and the car I just bought is in the shop. I'd give up if that were an option, but so it goes. Anyway, I didn't intend for this to be a confessional. I'm just hoping someone will share a pizza so I don't have to cook tonight. I can throw together a quick salad to go with it and feed the kiddo and the grandparents for a relatively stress free meal.

So, I want to surprise my boyfriend with a pizza since he doesn't have much at the base he is in right now (29 Palms). However, my wallet just took a toll from buying textbooks and neither of us are getting paid til Friday. I/we would be so grateful if someone could send a pizza or even a gift card to cover partial cost at Domino's.

Fantastic: my apartment has cockroaches. I usually cook, but...
My building has a bit of a bug problem. Those beetles I thought were harmless/part time winter roomies? Turned out to be an infestation of cockroaches.  I'm usually good about living with creepy crawlers, but after finding one floating in a cup of tea... (YUP.) not so much. I've thrown out everything in the cupboard - including food, pots &amp; utensils in preparation for the exterminator. Ordering in has put a bit of a strain on my wallet - Id really appreciate a pizza my way!

My little cousins showed up, know it's Nat'l Pizza, &amp; expecting Pizza, but I got empty pockets.
I never done this before so I don't know how this works exactly but I'm desperate. My little cousins surprised me today by showing up at my house. They are my Cousin's kids.  She's gotta work an overnight shift and can't find a baby sitter. She's gonna pick them up tomorrow. It all happened spur of the moment. That is not the problem though. The problem is somehow they found out it National Pizza Day and they are expecting Pizza. After paying bills and grocery shopping I'm tapped out. I can't tell them that. They are just kids. They wouldn't understand. I don't want to disappoint them. They know me as the fun uncle type (even though we're cousins) who always comes through for stuff like this. I just don't want to see the disappointment on their faces as I tell them that we can't get the Pizza. Please help me out. Thank you for taking the time to read this at least.

Recent NYC transplant, broke for the remainder of the week
Moved to NYC recently, having hard times. It's more expensive than I thought here. I get paid in a few days (taxes savin' my life) but I'd really like a pizza to get by. There is a place right below my apartment that I can get a whole cheese pizza super cheap with a 5 dollar off coupon I have for GrubHub (~$12), or we have Domino's and Papa John's. Thanks for being rad, RAOP. You've helped me out a couple times over my struggling youthful years, I'm really trying not to be such a burden on the system in the future.

believe in karma, Utah
Hey guys, I'd like to try and cash in on my karma. 

I've always been a firm believer that if you have a smoke to spare, you spare it, because one day you'll be out of smokes and wish somebody would help you. This extends to everything honestly.

Would anyone be willing to be my karma bro and hook me up with some pizza?

What's better than a new job? A new job AND pizza for dinner!
My boyfriend and I have been pretty strapped for cash lately - and by lately, I mean the last six months. He's been unemployed, and while we've managed to scrape by without racking up loads of credit card debt, we've done so by cutting out all of the fun and delicious things in our life, like pizza.

He finally found a new job. It's not ideal - training is unpaid, and he doesn't get in until 9PM in the evening - but it's a job, so we'll take it! To celebrate, I'd love to surprise him with a delicious pizza. We live in suburbs of Denver, CO and have loads of options nearby - Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Dominos, Marcos, and something called BlackJack Pizza. I'll be happy to pay it forward in a month, when we're a bit better off financially.

Thanks in advance!

little something to help me pull an all nighter
Hello. I'm a 1st year college student and I HAVE 3 TESTS TOMORROW!

It's like professors PLAN this crap, amiright?

lol anyways, it's starting to look like an all-nighter and I could really use a pick-me-up, since i've been studying since I got home today, plus I could use the leftovers for tomorrow.

Thanks for reading!

Hangry in Canada
hi. Long story short. Boyfriend had a really crappy pay check, we paid a large portion of our rent and some surprise bills. Have very little food until 20th which is next pay period. We're getting on each others nerves because he doesn't want to eat the chicken noodle soup or kraft dinner - and that's all we really have at the moment, so I  figure why not try asking for a Pepperoni Pizza?

Canadians aren't built to be hangry - we get mad, then feel really guilty about it + Hunger.

Closes pizza joints are Pangago, Dominos, Pizzahut, and Boston Pizza. We are Canadian, in BC.

Thanks a lot:)

Help me out with some pizza and I'll show my appreciation via craftiness
Hi, everyone! I've been going through a bit of a rough patch, unfortunately. Long story short, family life is bad, depression is killing my college GPA and I'm short on money, So I'd really appreciate the gift of a pizza! In return I will draw your username or make you a bracelet or something equally rad. I'm a bit crafty, so just let me know, and I'm sure we can work something out. Seriously though, a pizza would make my night. Regardless, you are all awesome and I hope you have a great night.

I really want to get my friend some pizza for his birthday, but I'm beyond broke.
So, I've got this long-time friend that I rarely get to see because he lives on the opposite side of the country. He just got laid off from his job, his birthday is coming up, and he loves Pizza Hut. I would love to get this guy some pizza because he deserves it for being such an awesome friend (he's even given me a random act of pizza before). Even if I had money, I couldn't really justify spending enough to get him a pizza delivered. So, could anyone help me get a good birthday gift for my friend?

Two College kids looking for some late night dinner.
Hey guys, my room mate and I are currently sitting in our dorm room (University of Pittsburgh), "Fresh off this stat homework" -my roommate, watching some college basketball. We don't really have much money, since we are college students. We work 3 nights a week reffing intramural basketball, and get paid in 2 weeks from tomorrow, which we will then pay forward. Thanks in advance!

The struggle is real
I live in Littleton, Colorado. Work a minimum wage job that has recently cut my hours due to more hires, even though I have told them that I need many hours as I have bills and rent to pay. So I live pay check to pay check and I just used all the cash I had for rent, I was 40 dollars short on that. I have nothing to eat and the only food in my apartment is my roommates which I can't touch (That was one of the rules). The only time I ever actually get to eat is when I am working as I get free food. But that means I'm screwed on my days off since I can only get a discount. I am starving and would love a pizza. I know pizza hut and domino's have good coupons up right now. I can't offer you anything in return such as a drawing or anything like that. But I can promise to pay you back some how or pay for a pizza for some one on here when I am able to. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Pizza to celebrate a new job
After years of shitty contract work, I've *finally* landed a job with an awesome metal roofing company.

I want to celebrate my first "win" in a while with my family. I've been craving plain cheese pizza from this restaurant for ages.

Help us have a pizza party tonight!

Hi (: I go to UNCG in NC, and I've been really frustrated with my dorms internet lately. I can't even play games because it keeps randomly dropping. I forgot to eat dinner tonight, while struggling with it, and I don't have any $ to get anything. I'll hopefully make it till morning, but a pizza would be absolutely incredibly appreciated!

Pizza in Minden La USA for small family.
Dealing with a lot of emotional legal troubles right now and I'm just frazzled and drained. I forgot to set out anything for dinner, my husband will be home in a couple hours, I can't go get any groceries until Sunday and my daughter just ate a cold hot dog. A warm pizza would restore my faith in humanity right now. Totally willing to pass it on when we get a chance to. Have verification, but this is my first time. Willing to learn.

Pizza for Poor Uni student in the UK.
I've never done this before or expect this to actually work, but recently I just signed on for a student house which 3 of my friends and I are going to live in for our final year at Uni. 
What we didn't know was that we had to pay the deposit and loads of other fees just to take the house off the market so other people can't view the house and secure our names onto the agreements for next year. 
The total bill for each of us came to £1,048 which I had to pay last week. Now I am left with about £3.80 in my pocket until Monday (when I receive my next batch of student loans)

Like I said I'm not expecting anything to come out of this, but if there is some kind soul out there willing to help out. I promise you when I get back on my feet I will show you my gratitude.

I just moved in with my boyfriend recently in a town that is an hour and a half from where I was living. I've been having a difficult time finding a job, so in the mean time, my boyfriend has been working 10-12 hour shifts trying to support us both and help me through school. I feel horrible about it, and you guys could help me make it up to this wonderful guy.

Pizza would make my day!
Hello. My name is Trina and I am currently waiting for my full disability funds to kick in to assist me for the next few months as I had a terrible fall due to the ice and snow and have broken my arm quite badly. I've had to have one surgery thus far and my recovery has been a bumpy road. While recovering I've been evicted from my apartment and forced to sell all of my possessions to have enough funds to move into cheaper living accomodations. While trying to make ends meet and doing whatever I've needed to keep afloat (babysitting as I am a Early Childhood Educator) I have damaged my arm further and apparently will require an additional surgery. I'm honestly terrified to reach out to friends, family and strangers but at this point I'm struggling everyday to make it through. Any help is beyond appreciated and I can't even begin to explain what it would mean to me if I had enough funds again to pay my cell phone bill and talk to family again... To be able to afford healthy snacks so my bones can grow stronger... MMMM.... PIZZA! &lt;3 And to be able to smile each day knowing that eventually my recovery won't hurt as much because of the hope I've lost.

Landed a bar job after a few weeks of being homeless!
Been homeless and sleeping rough for a couple of weeks, but a friend helped me out with his sofa and a hot shower. He also offered me his food, but I didn't want to abuse his help too much so I just cooked pasta for the last 5 days, cheap and filling. Today I finally landed a job starting Monday, and would love to surprise him and thank him, and this is the best I could think of.

Things are looking up!

Hey all, How's your day going? I hope it's good. Mine isn't so bad either. However, being a college student with a birthday on Valentine's kinda sucks because all your buddies have dates or other things to do than hang out and get drunk. If any of my fellow redditors could find it your heart or wallet to send a pizza my way, I'd love ya.

College couple in need of some love for Valentine's Day
Hey everyone, I'm a college sophomore at Christopher Newport University. My girlfriend and I are completely broke and decided not to do anything big for Valentines Day. What we did end up agreeing on was a Sex/Pizza/Lord of the Rings Marathon weekend, which we will be starting tonight with Fellowship of the Ring. However, while the mind and body are both willing for what's to come, the wallet is unresponsive to the pleasures of the physical world. So I was hoping to ask that maybe someone help me out and give my girlfriend a nice, homely weekend with some Domino's (or whatever kind of pizza, doesn't matter). I do of course promise to return the favor twice over as soon as I can (hopefully I'll start receiving regular paychecks in the near future). Thank you all for taking the time to read this, love you all Reddit.

Having an awesome week! (Toronto)
I've been having the best week so far. After month of trying to find work I finally got a job today! On top of that I saw my psychiatrist yesterday and was able to put things into perspective. I've been feeling down and stressed out about life for the last few months but talking about the goals I've achieved really made me feel great. I've been working out for the last month, I've been motivated to get back into school, and I have been eating healthy and thinking positive despite everything going on around me. 

My girlfriend and I won't really be able to do much for Valentine's Day tomorrow because of cash shortage so it'd mean a lot if someone could help us celebrate with pizza and keep this good week going :) it's not necessary but it'd be a nice treat. Regardless of the outcome I hope everyone who reads this has a good day tomorrow and and even greater week; stay positive everyone!

Single college girl with her cat in need of pizza on valentines day.
I am sitting on the couch alone in my apartment and in serious need of pizza. I looked over at my cat and he even looks sorry for me. (I think his girlfriend is the cat across the way.) But I have a midterm to study for and the second season of House Of Cards to watch. So really who needs a valentines when there is a Dominos down the road? 

Pizza aside, happy valentines day to all the single lady and misters. In the words of Zac Effron, 'Were all in this together."

To be honest, I'm not single. But my girlfriend lives overseas, so I can't spend the day with her. Aside from that though, my family is out of town and I don't know anyone locally, so I'm gonna be on my own tomorrow. A pizza would be enough to allay my woes. Anyone want to help a bother out?

Broke, tired of ramen, could really use a pizza right now.
This is really strange, I've never done anything like this, but I hope I'm doing this right. It's been a really tight month. For the most part it hasn't been so bad, but the last couple weeks I've been living off of ramen and peanut butter on stale bread. I'm overdrawn with the bank until at least Tuesday, and I can grind out a few more days like this, but man, a hot pizza would really help get me over this hump.

I would be very grateful if anybody was willing to help me out. I'd even get you a pizza in a few days when I've got some extra money.

I'm EST and have a verification code. Thanks for reading!

I do this same thing on tf2 for items, but recently I noticed I have very little food at home right now, and unless I wanna eat a plain bagel for dinner tonight, I might as well try and be a showpony for food. Here's my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5PFZcViQTxIeTV_apQJNYQ/), which has a couple videos on it now of me doing things for TF2 items. You can request similar activities, where I play a guitar really terribly and sing a song, I can do anything really.

Just got a cancer diagnosis. A pizza sounds good right about now.
Hi Reddit! Earlier this week, I got some bummer news: I've got me  case of Hodgkin's Lymphoma. (Don't worry, I'm not gonna die! This cancer is very treatable.) My appetite has been affected by the illness and most foods don't sound very good to me right now, but I think I could get down with a sweet, sweet Papa John's pie. I can't justify making the purchase myself since I've gotta save every penny right now to cover medical bills, but if someone is feeling generous, I'd be eternally grateful. I'm in Lincoln, Nebraska. If you need proof of my diagnosis, I'm happy to provide it. [Here's me in the hospital yesterday just before getting my port implanted! ](http://i.imgur.com/xvOx6mP.jpg)

I'd really just love to be lazy and have pizza for dinner
Today was Valentine's day and our plans were cancelled due to crummy weather here in NJ. So instead of dropping off our 13 month old at his grandparent's house, he trashed the house and is currently refusing to go to bed. I really don't want to do much other than sleep after the night we had with him last night. Yay teething! 

Anyways, I obviously have to pick up and put everything away and do dishes but I'd really love to not have to make dinner and do it all over again. Does this make me a bad mom? I hope not. I'm just beat. I'm sure there's other people out there deserving of pizza too, so I thank you for your consideration anyways. :-)

There's [a place near me](http://ginospizzajc.com/) that's cheaper than dominos and has great pizza, but really I'd be happy with anything- we have papa john's, pizza hut, and dominoes in our area as well.

So my parents are out dancing for Valentine's day while my sis and I are home alone with our pup. Pizza sounds good for dinner. Not a sob story or anything but I kind of want to show my sis and parents that the people of the internet are awesome and people do stuff like this.

Preference: Domino's but open to others.
State: Cali

Thanks in advance you guys :)

I just want to relax and not have to cook dinner for once
Single mom to a toddler, low income, yadda yadda.  I got pizza'd about a year ago, but I hope it's okay I'm requesting again. 

I'm just tired of having to cook every night.  My daughter eats really well, she not picky at all which is awesome (her favorite foods are cabbage and plain rice!), but sometimes I just want to relax.  I work as a school bus driver and a lunchroom and playground para, and this past week has been really stressful because of behavior issues.  I had to write up one of my elementary kids for the first time and had to rearrange the whole bus's assigned seats because of bullying problems.  And a group of my high schoolers have been making some bad remarks about women and rape and such, so I've had to have conversations about respect and such. I doubt I got through to them.  It's been tough.

So a relaxing night with some warm food I don't have to slave over... That would be awesome.  I would buy somefood myself but I haven't been getting child support for the last month for reasons I won't get into, and I just can't afford it right now.

As a thank you I'll take a picture of a lemur sitting on one of my cats? Or my daughter with pizza sauce all over here face, because that's what happens when she eats pizza :)

My fiancee is recently unemployed and our pantry has been slowly dwindling. Would love some pizza to hold us off until I can stop by a food pantry.
Basically she just lost her job and I don't really make enough to support both of us. My entire paycheck is going to a parking ticket (my car was towed last week) and bills that are going to default if I don't make payments. 
We have been surviving off of pasta with butter, ramen, and rice for like the past week because the last of everything else ran out. 

I would love some real food to hold me off until I can go and ask a food pantry for help. We have a Papa John's that delivers to us. I can use the verification system as well if requested.

Canada, I shovel snow for a living during the winter. Today I left at 06:00 and got home at 18:00.
Would love to get some pizza to refuel before i head out again. Stupidly deposited my checked in an abm yesterday. I don't have over draft so that means I'm cash strapped for the net 3-5 business days.

Pizzas to surprise my family when they arrive home!
My grandma, grandpa, parents and siblings are on a trip and they're currently driving across the state back home. I'd like a pie or two to surprise them with so none of them has to cook for themselves! I would make a meal here but I'm down to 2 microwave chicken pot pies until I can go to the grocery store tomorrow!

Cheech and Chong movie day and feeling empty
My bestfriend who is going back off to college stopped by late last night and we spent so much time preparing a pizza only to forget about it in the oven and ruining our pizza potential. This is our last chance before he leaves me again S.O.S. !

The smallest pizza, for my mother and me please?
My mother is sick and I've come home to look after her. She suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and is developing early Alzheimer's. It's been... rough. Appears she hasn't much of anything in the way of food around. I just want to have a hot meal with her and do some catching up. 

If you could spare the smallest, cheapest pizza pie we would be truly, sincerely grateful. If not, I understand.

Plans got ruined... And I'm broke. Help?
I'm one of those people who eat when they're depressed.  Thankfully, I have a high metabolism or else I'd end up being even more self conscious (as if I'm not already.) Anyway... Plans got ruined today and now I just want pizza but I have no money to buy one. Could anyone help, please?

Btw I live in Florida and where I live, we have Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Papa Johns... if that helps.

Helped a friend out of cold, led me hungry
Hello fellow friends, redditors and pizza lovers alike.

My post today is simply to ask for the most basic of help in a situation when I'm in dire need. A friend suggested trying here the kind people of reddit, for he had been helped in a similar situation.

Let me first explain why I can no longer purchase myself groceries.

As of lat night I had 50$ in my bank account left for groceries. 

Last night was the coldest night in Toronto this year, so cold people lost lives last night. (can provide news link for proof). In the middle of the night at approximately 2:45 3ish sometime, I recieved a call from a friend who was at a bar. It turns out his wallet was stolen or misplaced during the night. He had nowhere else to turn, so he called me, which I told him he always could. Knowing the weather, and the situation I couldn't leave anyone stranded. 

I emailed him my last 50$ via e-transfer so I knew he'd be able to get home, think well he'll pay me back today. This morning, I recieve a message from him expressing is gratitude but at the same time explains he can't pay me back until Thursday when he recieved his pay. Now I'm okay with it, except that was my 50$ for food. And I hae now none left, and I am both hungry and stressed. Relievedhe is safe, but now I have left mysel dry. 

After explaining this to another friend looking for help for food, he suggested I try here.

Which brings me to the reason I'm positng.

I'm here today, asking for help. It could be anything, jut something that I could put in my stomach. I'm not picky, i just need a bit of help if it's possible.

If you have any questions or concerns, or if I've mistaken myself in the rules I do apologize please message me. I don't know where else to turn, I'm all out of resources!

Theatre student broke during tech week
So it's tech week for an enormous musical that I am in at my university, and I am about running on fumes here. Could really use a pizza boost to help me through this week. There's a pizza hut right down the road from me that does like an 8 dollar carryout large so you wouldn't have to pay delivery fees or anything. Would love if someone could help me out.

Worked three back-to-back 12 hour restaurant shifts...need pizza.
I work in a restaurant as a busser. For Valentines Day weekend I worked 1130-1230 then 1130-130, then 11-130 and just got off the lunch shift. I'm just hungry and way too tired to cook. If anyone took their loved one out for a romantic meal on Vday and had their food removed like, lightning fast, this is your chance to pay it forward.

Indianola, Iowa We could most definitely use a pizza.
My girlfriend just moved back home from college due to some severe depression. After over coming months of hospitalization and multiple medications her own mother won't let her move back in. She's having a rough time and could definitely use a pizza Reddit. Thank you.

I haven't ate in 3 days and all the kids have had for the past week is Ramen and hot dogs. If someone would be willing to send us a egift card for a couple pizzas I could return the favor when I get paid next Tuesday. Please and Thanks for reading.

About to be snowed in, will probably lose power, and working on a stressful presentation
My fiance and I are stuck in the house tonight, and I have a big presentation to give in a couple days so I can't give him the attention he deserves. We could really use a pizza, him, for the attention, and me, for the stress eating I need. I've also been dieting and this is my cheat day (if I get a pizza). Please and pizza. ily

Dudes&amp;dudettes, I just literally spent 2hrs drooling at food pictures online. That's some next level Bridget Jones shit. So...anyone wants to send this pathetic gal a pizza &amp; receive a postcard from London?
Anywhere to the world, with anything you want on it - the Queen, the Queen's corgi, the lovely London scenery, something artsy, or something completely unrelated and wacky!   
Of course, I'll also pay a pizza forward to this sub once my funds situation becomes less shitty.    
*Edit: Why so many downvotes, reddit? :( I understand that nobody has to buy me pizza - so hey, simply don't buy me pizza. But why all the virtual fuck-you-points? :( Anyway, have a lovely day, y'all. *

Want to surprise fiance with pizza, he always treats me to dinner dates
Two college students here, and whenever he gets some extra cash he treats me to a dinner date. I would love to get him a pizza seeing as I can't work and as a way to say "I love you" and thanks for always paying for all the food and dates, seriously it'd mean a lot to me.

Never done this before so I have no idea what to do but I know I would like some pizza :D
Today is Tuesday, and I know Dominoes has a 2 for Tuesday deal, and I won't make you buy me some fancy pizza - just cheese and tomato will do. I was just curious as to whether or not someone would really just buy someone else a pizza.

Full time student interested in a little help with a pizza.
The past couple years has been a very bleak period in my life. Until very recently, depression and anxiety has left me with no income and homelessness. (Both of these are a first for me... talk about ego crushing...)

Over the past 8 months or so, I have been fighting my way back into the real world again. In a desire to put myself in a much better place, I've decided to start attending college for the very first time.

I am currently working on a general engineering degree at my local community college. I intend to transfer to a Electrical/Electronics Engineering college for my bachelors if I can secure the grants and scholarships to pay for it.

At the start of this month, I've lost the means I normally use to buy food. Because of this, I've been primarily eating noodles and would really enjoy some variety.

If someone would be willing to help me out with this, I would be extremely grateful! I will happily pass on the kindness when I have the means to do so.

Thank you so much!

(I can provide a copy of my student ID if needed)

Pretty basic, I had to spend the last of my money to get a lease on my apartment, and can't afford anything till my first paycheck comes in. Anything would be appreciated, even if it's just a couple of dollars for rice and beans.

Looking to trade silly pictures of my dog for some pizza (Texas)
Here's the deal, you pick a silly pose for my dog, and I will do my best to create the pose and post a picture. If you feel that the photo I took meets the criteria for your requested pose, you reward me with some pizza! I have a Domino's near me. My dog's name is Thor. He is a terrier mix and he is awesome! Here's a photo I just took of him this morning, he wasn't ready to wake up. http://i.imgur.com/gBF5vKB.jpg And here are a couple of him I took this past Christmas. http://i.imgur.com/gA2iTAt.jpg http://i.imgur.com/5UcjvH9.jpg And here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpbSDX0HUb0&amp;feature=youtu.be) of him vs a blanket he got for Christmas.

Last night in America, going back home tomorrow
Hey guys!

So It's my last night in America after my stay in Austin for the Last 6 months. Everything is in bags and ready to go, and I was wondering if one of you lovelies would be up for being lovely?

I can absolutely pay it forward as soon as I am back in England, and will do so as soon as I see someone in need of a glorious pizza!

Thanks guys
Love the work you do!

My dinner tonight consists of saltines, peanut butter, and cheese.
It's sort of a bitter sweet story; I got accepted into Grad school so my food budget for the month was cut short by fees to pay for sending transcripts and a caregiver background check. Unfortunately, my long-term educational investment has left me nutritionally deficient in the short-term. 

Here is a picture of my beautiful dinner:

Broke and struggling for a pie.
I'm very broke and currently going through quite a bit of problems. My father hasn't been helping our family out and it's takin it's toll. He claims me on income taxes along with my mom and brother yet doesn't support his family like he should. Last month he got a 250$ check and not a dime went to filling our cupboards. 
My mother has been considering EBT and good stamps in order to support us but we need help with providing a meal for tonight..
I understand that this is not reddits responsibility to help us for tonight but if someone were too I could assure that one day we will pay it forward.

My location is Owosso

Two porn stars in need of pizza.
I know this sounds silly, but a friend and I are stuck in a motel in Oakland for a shoot and we don't get paid until tomorrow night and even then, we need to wait ANOTHER day to cash the checks. I'm not expecting people to feel sorry for us, since we make a goddamn decent amount of money. We would just appreciate it if someone found this so embarrassing and hilarious that they bought us a $10 dinner box from Pizza Hut or something. Nothing extravagant. We're pigs, but we aren't THAT bad. We're just broke until two days from now and don't want to starve I guess? Cool so I guess that about wraps this up.

I'm sick with a cold that won't stop and would love a pizza.
I've managed to come down with the cold from hell. Coughing, wheezing, runny nose like nobody's business, not to mention the body aches and everything else.

I'm tired, hungry, but entirely too sick to get up and make anything worthwhile. In reality, a sick person probably should not be eating pizza but I'm craving it so badly.

My general location is the Piedmont Triad, North Carolina.

one of the worst weeks of my life
I know this is asking for some sympathy but I feel the need to throw a little pity party right now. This week has been hell on earth. Ive lost track of days. One of my friends hung himself about a week ago I think?, and two days ago I think? my boyfriend of four years dumped me. 

Needless to say I've been a friggin mess. And seem to be in a downward spiral. But there have been people that have been there for me and kept me sane. A couple friends that have brought over food and made me eat, and cleaned up my mess of a house so Id be able to be at home and be comfortable while I curl up into a tiny ball and curse the world ha , and of course sat and drank with me and toasted to our friend while I bawl my eyes out. 

I want to do something for them, and have a random excuse to force myself out of my house and share some food with them and just be around people that are going through the same hurt. I'm on such a tight budget that I can't afford to do anything for them myself. I can pay forward or pay back any pizza money in early march but until then I have to be super frugal. 

I'm alone and I'm trying to process everything, still doesn't feel real. I want to give anything back to the people I care about and that have been caring for me I want to feel like I've made someone happy and feel some sort of connection. 

I know a pizza isn't going to make any of this better or easier and It's probably some stupid excuse to just rant a bit but right now it sounds like the perfect Idea. I'd really appreciate it. I'd love to just show up at my girlfriends place tonight with a cheese pie and a fake smile. Thanks for your time.

Seriously could use a pick me up
I have had an awful month. With money being tight, short on rent finally paid back what I owed. Was gonna save the rest that I had after I paid my phone bill for rent next month, but I am gonna be short on that again and had to extend my phone bill. Phone broke on me yesterday cost a lot just to get a new one in... I feel like I am at the lowest point well close to it. Could really use a pizza.

Edit: I live in colorado and when i get the chance i will pay it forward.

No money, no food, a lot of snow and 2 days until tax refund comes in
I'm a married mom of three in the Northern Kentucky area.  I won a contest on here a little over a week ago.  Times are still rough, though.  I'm on suspension from work and they won't tell me why or even just fire me so that I can move on.   In a couple of days, we will have our tax money and can start paying this forward.  Thanks for reading!

We're barely making it and I don't have a job just yet and i would love to share a nice meal with them :) Any help is appreciated. tl;dr? Kicked out of college, want nice meal with family also if i was a female and a nun, id change my name to nature..... Awkward ok bye

Something different than pasta
I make enough to keep trucking, but can't often afford nicer food between bills and loans. I mostly eat pasta and pasta sauce every night and take everyday vitamins to stay on. Today, I am looking after a friend's kid, and I was hoping I could get a pizza to enjoy and share for a change. I can pay it forward after the week's end.

Would appreciate the help.
Figure I would give it another shot today. Things are still the same, really tight on money and could really use the help. I dont have any food in the house since I havent been able to go shopping cause all my money goes to rent and I really do work pay check to paycheck. After my phone shitting out on me things have gotten more stressful. I have been an emotional wreck and would really love to eat something today. I don't have any friends I can call and ask to help me out. Sorry, I sound like I'm throwing a pity party and I guess I kind of am. 

I live in colorado and I would love it if any of you are kind enough to help me out.

My phone was stolen and my laptop stopped working. I just graduated and am a web developer.
Like I said, my phone was stolen and my laptop is no longer functioning. This happened within the same week, and as a web developer I need both of these items to work and stay in touch with the people for whom I work. I also graduated from college less than a year ago and my loan payments are due, and all of my savings are going toward these replacements.

I could really use some pizza right now! Thank you so much!

Missionary Teacher living in Honduras working with 1st-3rd graders. Money is tight and of course I miss home. Looking for some pizza to help me get through a rough day of homesickness.
Believe it for not they have pizza down here and I've been here since the beginning of January. I won't be home for another two months and I miss my family and fiance. I am saving what little money I make so can't justify buying pizza here (even though its about 6 bucks for a large). Having pizza would give me a nice thing to look forward to at the end of the day, and of course would remind me of Michigan.

So I just dropped my wife off at the train station so that she can have a weekend away and our van's battery died just as I pulled into the drive way. Looking forward to being a bachelor dad this weekend and have lots of fun with the kiddo, but this battery thing puts a snag in our plans.

We just got hit with a big plumbing bill this week, and this would be a great pick me up! Thanks in advance!

Cold, $3 to my name, and about to embark on a statistics study session.
Hey guys its been a rough week to be a college student. I keep losing all my shit, as in possessions and my sanity. I'm talking wallet, university ID, and my favorite pair of black shorts and acquired a nice cut on my head from banging it into a metal light switch box. Its negative 15 outside and I'm about to start cramming for my Statistics Exam tomorrow. A pizza would be lovely! Thanks!

Our plea for pizza!
We're two broke college students living in Gainesville, Florida (Go Gators!), and a pizza would be really great. We have job interviews set up for the end of the week, so this would help tide us over til then.

Will be at an out-of-town hospital for treatment 2/23-2/27
Hi guys, 
I have a chronic pain disorder known as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. Next week(2/23-2/27), I will be receiving treatment in Atlanta about 6 hours from where I live. I wanted to submit the request early because next week I will be heavily medicated!

 My mom will have to stay at a hotel which also means eating out &amp; stuff.  My mom has been really stressed about money as she had to close our family restaurant &amp; my treatment is extremely costly &amp; not always covered by insurance. Additionally, there are the travel costs and the costs of my prescriptions. It all adds up very quickly and we have been doing this for over six years. 

I am in the process of applying for disability so I have no income right now but I was hoping that someone may step in one day next week &amp; send my mom a pizza at her hotel while I am in the hospital. I wish that I would be able to afford to do this for her myself. She is such an amazing caregiver and spends a majority of her time helping me to be as pain-free as possible even if it means that we suffer financially. I am so grateful for her &amp; all she does while asking nothing in return. I would love to be able to surprise her and say dinner one night is taken care of.

Whatcom county, WA
Long story short my family couldn't pay rent, we were forced to split up and fend for ourselves. My older brother and I found a place. Were very tight on money because I was recently fired and he is saving up for a desperately needed car. I know there is a pizza god with many disciples. We may not have money, but I can send a nature picture of our beautiful county and when we do get back on our feet  I shall try to return the kindness.

These Kidney Stones are Hell. Possibly Worse.
Like, forreals. I haven't been able to stand up for more than about 30 seconds in the last 72 hours. In that span of time, I've crawled to the kitchen once to make myself my last Cup 'O Noodles, because that was easy enough to dump a bit of water into and slam the "2:00" button before laying back down on the living room floor.

I seriously.... ugh. I'm 25, and this is at least my 9th kidney stone. It's my third one in the last 18 months. I really, really, think I have some sort of disorder or like... I don't even know. Something really obscure. I think I need Dr. House to tell me I have XXXXXXXXititis. Or -osis. Or something.

At any rate; I lost my job last month, am living off of my school grants, and have now hit the point where anything I have to eat is very labor-intensive, as it requires me to take out my mixer and do all sorts of stirring/baking/pan jiggling, and oh dear God, that all just. Yeah. I can't even walk my ass to the bathroom right now.

If someone could help me out, I'd be able to eat for the next two or three days, because cold pizza FTW. 

Ugh. I feel so shitty asking people for help. WoW trained me really damn well, hahaha.

I'm hoping r/RAOP can help me today. I haven't had a pizza in a long time and I recently got a new job. Now I'm sick at home and food (specifically pizza) is all I can think about. 

I'm in the Urbandale area of Iowa, USA. If you can help, then thanks, if not don't sweat it.

Running out of food, could use some pizza to brighten the kids day...
We are a family of five with one income and we are constantly struggling financially. We were relying on our tax return to come in so we could get back on track and finally go to the store. But, because of the recent snow, our refund has been delayed and we are having a really rough time. We are running low on food in the house and cannot afford to go to the store until either payday next week or whenever our tax return comes in.

The kids finished off the last of the cereal this morning and the financial stress of the family seems to be getting my older kids down. I would love to be able to surprise them with an unexpected pizza for dinner.

Long week, partner came out as trangender to the world tonight, precisely £0.00 in the current account. Back into work on Sunday, 3 weeks of maths (OU degree) behind. Any love for a couple of UK pizza lovers?
As above really. It's been a pretty long week and just when I thought the weekend was here I get roped into working Sunday.  
  
I'm doing a degree with the OU and with everything involved in my partner coming out, I have fallen behind on studying which I need to try and make up tonight and tomorrow.  
We have no money until payday and I'm fed up of soup and noodles.  
  
I believe what goes around comes around, and will be happy to gift some pizza to the world on or just after payday!

Low on cash due to unforeseen dental surgery. Will be able to pay it forward later this week!
Hey guys,

Just wondering if anyone would be kind enough to spot me a pizza tonight! I've had to have root canal treatment and just completed my second stage a couple of days ago. The thing is that these surgeries cost quite a lot and have hit me unexpectedly :S

I'm not really feeling another carton of yoghurt and would love a warm treat! I can definitely pay it forward later this week when I get paid!

Can you please help a struggling college student.
I'm currently going to a public university in Illinois. It has turned out to be costly for me, especially getting the money for rent. I just work part time  15 hours a week as a busboy and sometimes I barely make the rent. Unfortunately this is one of those week in which I have to limit myself to eat less. Can someone please help me out with a pizza and I promise to pay it back when I can.

Struggling college student could use some pizza.
I hate to ask, but I'm down to my last cup of rice that's supposed to last until at least the end of the month. I have a job on campus but they overhired so I only get 3 hours a week at federal minimum wage and my next measly $25 pay check probably won't be deposited until later next week.

If I could just get a pizza to make my pantry last a day longer until my paycheck comes or my family has the money to help I'd be very grateful.

A pizza will be highly appreciated to say the very least!!!

Movie night snack?
Tonight is a sleepy saturday night spent in watching netflix. Unfortunately, I recently found out that my student loan won't be covering my summer semester's tuition, so money is pretty tight as I'm trying to save up $1,300 to continue with schooling. It would be great to eat well tonight and really enjoy my night off of work. I'm in the GTA, Ontario, Canada.

Enjoy your night everybody!

Stuck at work. Getting hungry.
So I'm in East TN and we just got wrecked with the worst ice storm in about 50 years. I've been stuck in this pet store making sure our animals are safe, warm, and fed for almost 2 days without money and I'm getting hungry. Anyway someone could be a real hero and send me some pizza and love. (The animals are looking tasty) [UPDATE] I've made it home to my wife. Animals are still alive.

Finally getting the help I need and you can help too!
Most of my life I've had bad problems with motivation and mood swings. I've lost 2 jobs now to being so down right depressed I just wouldn't get out of bed. The last one I even cried at work. When I managed to calm myself down(luckily I worked in meat in a super market so I was able to hide out) I called one of the night managers. I tried to calmly explain that I cried my eyes out and I wanted to go home, but embarrassingly I cried right in front of him too.  
  
But enough of that sob story. I've finally started getting help. I've talked to my doctor last week and we talked a lot about my problems with my mental state. She managed to recommend and get me an appointment with a Psychiatrist. In the interim she has me on a trial basis of Wellbutrin and its going to take a while to actually do anything. The first open Psychiatrist appointment isn't until April so its going to be a bit of a wait.  
  
So I have no money and my family doesn't stock up the fridge. I can't touch a lot of whats in there and I'm sick of Ramen and eggs. Three different whole foods this past month didn't want to hire me. I just want something warm to eat.

A Pizza would help out a lot
I'm 19 and in my first semester of college and at this point it is becoming very overwhelming. I have $10 to my name with very little help from my parents, I have exams coming up soon, along with a 5 page paper and a speech due in the next couple days, and a pizza would really relieve some of my stress. I start my job on campus in a couple days so as soon as i get some money I'll make sure to pay it forward. Thank you.

I didn't know this sub was a thing until about 30 seconds ago, and I'm amazed and grateful that is exists. A fat pepperoni pizza would be great and undeserved help, would definitely hold me over until I'm mobile again tomorrow. Now, if only there was a "Random acts of web admin job"...

Been living off the dollar menu at taco bell/mcdonalds...
Hi all, I could really use a decent meal. Got laid off back in December and the job hunt hasn't been going well. Starting to sell of possessions just to pay rent. Could a pizza help? Maybe. But I know it would be tasty. Bit about me, left the air force after 10 years in April, moved to VA in July and got a pretty slick job doing IT/IA stuff for a government contract and then the funding fell out in December. Now it's like pulling teeth to get interviews.

Payday is 10 days and the pantry is looking sparse. AZ.
Hello generous redditors. This is my first request ever. Hopefully you'll take kindly to my story and send some cheesy goodness. 
As the title states, I won't get paid for ten more days. I just switched over from temping to full hire, but that means my paychecks are now only twice a month instead of weekly. At this point, we are in the gap and hungry. 
My wife and I have done our best to stretch what we have. Meals around here have consisted of dry cereal and a large bag of goldfish crackers. The crackers are gone, and the cereal is low. I discovered I had some instant yeast in the fridge and flour in the pantry. So I'll have homemade bread for the meantime, but that isn't exciting when we've already used all of the butter, jelly and peanut butter.
Your gifted pizza will be a treat. Savory goodness with more than just carbs. It will be greatly appreciated. And I will extend my gratitude by buying someone else here a pizza after I get paid.
Thank you.

I don't feel like going outside.
I know sob stories are par for the course here at RAOP, so I'll spare you mine (unless you really want to know, I'm sure it'll make a good memoir someday). Honestly, I'm just in a "I hate the world" mood and pizza would restore some faith in humanity. 

As you can see I've gotten pizza from this subreddit before and I'm super grateful. I get paid on Friday so whether or not I get any pizza tonight I'll return the favor then (feel free to PM me a reminder to keep me accountable).

Hungry and would love a hot meal. Will trade pics of my baby boa constrictor wearing hats, write a short story or handmade/one of a kind jewelry :)
Hello pie-lovers! I'd love a hot meal (my water is cut off till Fri, so a soda would be nice too ;)). Times have been tough, I'm looking for work and my stove/fridge were stolen a few months back, so my life has been mostly microwave + noodles for months. I'm hungry and feeling a bit down and this would be a huge pick-me-up. I am hoping to barter for Pizza Hut [it's the only place that's close/delivers, and I have no transportation to get anywhere else]. I can offer any of the following in exchange;

* Pictures of my baby boa constrictor, Hades, wearing hats, wielding a lightsaber, etc. He's a cute little cuddle sausage.
 
* Custom short story of 2k-5k words.
 
* Handmade, one of a kind jewelry that I make myself using high-quality materials (like Swarovski crystals). Here's some examples of my work; http://imgur.com/a/H6GmF

Been eating mostly snack bars till payday and would love some pizza.
I ended up getting charged more this month on bills because they didn't charge something properly last month, and now I'm just trying to make it through the week till payday. There are snack bars and popcorn at my work and I've been living off of those, but I just literally started drooling a little at the thought of pizza.

I'm on the peninsula in the Bay Area. I can pay you back on Friday morning with paypal, google wallet, or venmo, or in the meantime I can do art or calligraphy if you like!

Just really in the mood for some good pizza, unemployed so I can't buy some myself.

No real sob story either besides that i haven't had pizza from pizza hut/dominos/papa johns for a few years now. Last time I had any from those places was when Papa Johns was giving away a free pizza for guessing the coin flip correctly for the super bowl.

Thanks in advanced and if given the chance(I sometimes randomly get a chunk of cash) i'll pay it forward someday :)

Just got home from a little stay at the childrens hospital and our pipes are frozen!
My 2 year old ingested one of my dads blood pressure tablets the other day while he was babysitting her.  When we got her home an hour later she was acting loopy and drunk. We called 911 and were rushed to devos children's hospital. It took a couple days to get out of her system but she is currently doing great and is almost back to her normal self. 
We just got home a bit ago and our hot water pipes are frozen. I'm tired, gross and need a shower/bath an I just don't have the energy to cook for my 3 kids. 
The hubs is working a 3rd tonight and heads to his 2nd job right after. So its just me and the babes tonight.

Week three stuck in this staired prison
Week three stuck in the apartment with a broken leg.
Today while grabbing a shirt to wear I started talking to my clothes. Upon grabbing a pink tank top I saw under it, a black one. 
"I am ever so sorry, but I must put you back" 
I said to the pink tank in my hand. 
"the black tank is newer and has a much better fit, I hope you will forgive me."
I placed it back in its home among pj pants where it would not see light until the next day, hoping to be chosen.

So yea I'm going a bit stir crazy confined to my apartment &gt;.&gt;
Noms? 
Also does anyone else like Papa Johns bbq or spinach pizza? That stuff is amazing!

Wife just lost her job. It was a vast majority of our income. Some pizza would really take the sting off.
We are a family of four. My wife just lost her job of five years, which means we now have virtually no income. I work from home, and I'm just beginning a career as a writer doing a lot of freelance work, so the amount of money I contribute is minimal. She had just graduated college with a Bachelor's in math, and we figured we had a little time for her do a job search. We thought she would have no problem finding something new while still at her current job, but we were really blindsided by this.  We are now both desperately searching for any job we can get because we just dumped our entire savings into buying a used car for her job (we were previously borrowing my dad's car). We live in Colorado, and  we could really use some pizza right about now to lift our spirits. We would both be happy to pay it forward many times over as soon as we find jobs.

A bit tired of plain noodles and frozen veggies
Hello everyone,

I've been in a bit of a tight spot over the last half year or so. Moved from the East to the West Coast to get myself a fresh start away from some not-so-great circumstances. I've been getting by with crappy jobs and eating noodles and frozen veggies for a while now, and now I'm a little more stable and I'm trying to finish up school and hopefully get a better job. Not starving or anything, but certainly wouldn't mind a little meat, or anything other than noodles really, to help me get through this week! I'm in the Bay Area, Northern California. Much appreciated if anyone is willing to help me out!

Not a sob story, but an I've-almost-made-it-just-one-more-week story. First time requester-lady getting back on her feet.
Hi there! I never thought I'd be requesting help from my lovely fellow Redditors. I've had a rough last few years with leaving my partner and moving to a new state, realizing I couldn't get over my abusive relationship alone, and taking some time off (and all my savings) to really get myself in a good headspace -- which included going to a domestic violence rehabilitation center. Long story short: work odd jobs and saved up to move to a new place, just got a nicer paying contract job, and then after a year of bouncing around, finally got an apartment of my own! This means I used all my resources and still haven't gotten gas/elec in my place yet (so I can't cook cheap food at my place), etc. However! I get my first paycheck from this new gig early next week, and just had my first day of volunteering at a nearby women's shelter today! I'm looking for some food to tide me over -- I know I will be able to scrape by after next week, so I don't want to take time or resources that people really need (gov't stuff, food pantry, etc). But I would so love a warm slice (or anything warm really) tonight, and some extra to save for the next few days to have around my (new and totally mine!) place. Thanks, Reddit. I promise to pay it forward. Edited: Wanted to add I can barter some stuff as well: I write, review video games and can score some codes for certain iTunes games, will send postcards from California (where I am!) or write you a personalized poem! !

Broke College Kid on Foot (Waco, TX)
Hey There,

I'm feeling really nervous about posting this, because it's slighty embarrassing to ask for a hand out but I don't know what else to do. So I'm just going go for it. I'm going to school (18 hrs) and working (30 hrs) just to pay rent. I have no car and no bike. I walk to school everyday, I walk to work, and then I walk home. My bank account is -70 dollars because all the late fees from not paying my rent on time cleared and now I'm in the negative. If I could just get something small to eat, it would really boost my spirit. Anyway, I've gone on too long. Thank you for reading. I hope to talk to someone soon.

Brighten Grandfather's day
So, due to various circumstances, I'm having to stay with my 85 year old grandfather. He is diabetic and has a quadruple bypass but still fiery and lovely. I adore him and would love to surprise him with a pizza. As you can see, I'm a long-time giver and lover of RAOP so this would mean a lot. I think we're in delivery area of all of the big Pizza chains...So, if you would give a gift certificate it would mean a lot.

Love and hugs, raspberry.

Midterms are coming up next week and the snow day has closed most of the options on campus. Just got broken up with by my first real boyfriend and would love some pizza to chew over while I deal with these Arabic flashcards and Calculus problems. No big sad story, just hungry college students stressing this week.

Caught the flu from my god daughter and would love some pizza to cheer us both up in our sick days.
Hi.

I live with my two friends and their daughter, and she came home the other day sick with the flu, and guess who caught it? If you guessed me, then you're right.

Me and her are here alone watching movies in our sickness while the other two friends are at work, and it's snowing(yay!).

If anyone would be so kind as to get us a pizza I'll gladly repay it any way we can think of.

Sick of ramen and no money until next week, pizza would be the tits!
As of two weeks ago, I've secured employment and I'm officially off the Canadian government feeding tube! This also means a 2-3 week lull in income and some pizza would make the next week amazing.

To sweeten the deal a little, I'll dust off my drawing tablet and **give a generous Redditor a sketch of whatever the heck they want!** Quality of sketch is not guaranteed and may evolve into something more refined if the mood strikes.

I've lost 40 lbs on a carb-free diet, and just found out I passed my nursing boards! I've earned a cheat night, and would die for a pizza.
I've been following a ketogenic diet for a looooong time now. Only meat, cheese, and veggies. No bread, no sugar, etc. I've been doing this while attending nursing school, and I just found out that I passed my NCLEX, which means I am OFFICIALLY a nurse! I always said I would celebrate with a well-deserved cheat, but nursing school has drained my funds. I live near Pizza Hut and will happily repay the favor once I get a nursing job and start making good money. Thanks guys, this community is incredible.

Real pizza in Tokyo... please!
I am not sure if you know but pizza in Japan is, well, not what I am used to in Canada. Mayo sauce, seaweed flakes, and it's not exactly a cheap food here.

I know a restaurant near my place that serves italian style pizza and I want to go so bad. Things have been tough and I am feeling home sick.

A large pizza can run 30-40 dollars here, though I don't need a large. If someone gets me this pizza it's very generous of them.

If you are around Tokyo we could arrange to eat together. If not I could probably send you a postcard from Japan if you're comfortable giving me that information. Otherwise I could offer a drawing (not an artist, low quality), a short story, or possibly do a small piece of english to japanese translation for you (within reason).

If anyone does end up getting me the pizza I will be so grateful. 

Thanks for reading and wishing all the best to all the other hungry people out there.

Hi guys. I'm sick, snowed in, fridge is bare, got laid off. I'll draw you anything!
I got laid off last week (I'm 21. Awesome.) and would love to surprise my boyfriend when he gets off work with pizza instead of beans and rice. I would go to the store to buy stuff, but I'm sick as a dog (no voice, sniffling, gross) and the snow makes walking or driving impossible. I can draw you anything you'd like in response and mail it to you (I have stamps!!).

Really, I want to do this for my partner more than me. Seeing his goofy smile when he comes home to his sick girlfriend, thinking he'll have to take care of me and he has pizza? Yeah, I wanna see it. 

Thank you so much for reading.

My job has a temporary layoff due to lack of orders coming in. I have been without work for 3 weeks now, I do get unemployment, but only $200 every week, and my rent is $300 every week, so I have now used up all of my savings. :( All I have been eating is rice for the last 5 days. I can draw ponies if you want:

Hello my dear friends, I come with a request for a pie. I just recently got fired, and was unemployed for about 2 weeks, and needed to pay rent and all that jazz. I just got a new job that will be amazing for my career (I started on monday) but I won't start getting paid until the 6th. I reach out to you my fellow pizza lovers.

Nothing until tomorrow afternoon
Hey reddit, I screwed up. Just started a new job and paycheck was TINY last week. There are 4 of us 2 adult/2children. Right now we have rice in the pantry I'm about to have to figure out how to cook so thi kids will eat it.    I could really use even just one pie. I get my check tomorrow afternoon, so things get easy then.  I think dominos is the only place that delivers here (backwoods south carolina).  God bless all of you, especially if you're looking for food too.

I verified via the system thing, if needed I can show you the code.

Broke, hungry, no $ till friday
Hey guys, I posted on here 3 or 4 months ago and you guys were beyond kind. Unfortunately, things are not any better. I was sick for several days and could not work. My last bit of credit went to paying my internet so I can log in to find work.

My grandmother is nervous because she doesn't get her pension until friday and we only have a couple of chicken quarters and some potatoes left but Id rather make those later in the week. Would love some pizza for dinner. I know Dominos has that 2 for 5.99 offer in my area but whatever you can give would be great.

I fully intend to repay this subreddits kindness when I am back on my feet because I will be back on my feet. Thanks guys.

grad. It's been tough, I need a foothold.
Recent college grad.  Three months ago I had a girlfriend, an apartment of my own, and a job.  I lost them all at once, through no fault of my own, along with my health.  It's been a hell of a year, for sure.

I recently regained my health and I'm on the job hunt once again.  (Three interviews this week!)  But I'm flat broke in the meantime.  I'm reduced to eating cream of wheat twice a day.

You guys helped me out when I was struggling a couple of years ago.  I need the help of the reddit community again.  I'd love to get some actual nutrition in me.

Thanks, y'all are beautiful.

I'm stressed, sick and have almost no money at the moment. (20 MD)
I have been under a lot of stress due to doctors appointments causing me to miss class. Got an exam tomorrow that I haven't been able to study well for due to a head cold and the only food I have a the moment is fucking spaghetti. Don't get me wrong, I like my noodles, but it gets tiring eating that shit day in and day out. 

Would love to eat something different...

Pizza for my roommate.
Recently my employer was unable to pay me in full this resulted in my rent bouncing (rather it is about to bounce.) I was able to get full rent thanks to a kind redditor on r/borrow however rent comes out of my roommates account, I'm paying his NSF fee of course however there is still the fact that he is going to take a credit hit. Once I get all my monies back and that great redditor his money I will definitely pay it forward.

Portland OR. Not a great week so far, and need some help.
Not sure where I would begin with something like this. I tried requesting before, but this is one of those times where the motivation is just gone. Half way through work on Friday night, got a call my Aunt was in route to OHSU Hospital up here in PDX due to liver failure from a reaction to prescription medication, and I have been spending all my money on bus and cab fare to be with her since. I am more then two weeks away from my paycheck, rents late, food stamps still 7 days away (9th) and who knows when I need to get back to the hospital for the biopsy results. 


Help right now would be more then appreciated.  Of course not everyone is able to help when they want to, and I just wanted to let any who care know that just some words of encouragement or hell just someone to talk to would mean a whole lot more then you could ever know.


Hope everyone has a wonderful Monday, and for those of us in Portland OR, to enjoy the beautiful day we have =]

(Vancouver, WA) My wife is the best and we're too broke to get anything but mac and cheese.
My son (1.5yrs) and i have been sick the past three days and this woman is incredible. I have never seen anybody take such great care of 2 people. She is like supermom and wonder woman all balled together, but i can tell she's starting to hit her breaking point.

We recently were forced to go down to my one income and we're barely making it. We've been eating mac and cheese for like a week. A pie would bring this lady so much joy. Help me help my wife?

[UK] Was going to cook chilli for my boys tonight, ended with an unpleasant surprise.
So me and my boys were looking forward to having some nice homemade chilli, a welcome treat, instead of the usual processed frozen crap we usually have because it's cheap. However it turns out that someone else in the house has used up the last off my puree and tomatoes.

Would appreciate a couple pizzas for the family tonight! Thanks and much love!

Could really use some pizza for the house.
Never knew there was a thread like this and Kinda happy I found it. My mom just got back from her radiation treatment. Comes home lays down, I made her soup. She thanks me and randomly says "I'm craving pizza." I just smile at her. Thing is I recently lost my job and hardly have income to just buy pizza like that.

Queens NY...Tired of eating rice and beans with the best pizza ever right down the block.
New Park Pizza in Ozone Park...if you know you know. This place has been haunting me all week. If I had a pie I would try to find someone else hungry to give half of it away to. I'm just in a tight spot with less money in my bank account than needed to pay my bills, sincerely considering letting some weird rando touch my feet if it means I don't have to worry about this, am PMSing like nobody's business, finally quit smoking a week ago (going strong!!) and could really go for some pizza to mull this all over while I draw today.  
I moved out of NYC four months ago but came back to tie up some loose ends. Had some cash but also some unexpected expenses came up, and some expected payments didn't. I have a good steady gig waiting for me when I leave here in 3 weeks and would love nothing more than to pay it forward when I can. I'm just kinda having one of those days.  
PM's and chats are always welcome too.  
Thanks Reddit, you're weirdly lovely.

Pizza Poetry
Pizza was on my mind,

I didn't quite care what kind.

Thin, crispy, pan, or thick.

I just was craving something quick.

Pepperoni and sausage, cheesy and plain

Or something crazy, innovative and insane.

So I went to Reddit in hope of a pie

And don't know how to end this poem &gt;.&gt; bye

I would like to do something nice for my friend on her birthday. Help?
My best friend Jessica of 13 years, since we were kids, is having her 22nd Birthday on St. Patrick’s Day. I have already locked down a gift for her, a computer monitor from work but would like to be able to go the extra mile and surprise her with an easy meal. On occasion growing up her parents would take her to dinner to celebrate but unfortunately again this year they are unable to. Jessica has been through a lot to be this early on in her life. She lost her Grandmother, her rock, when we were around 13 which hit her hard considering her Mother has always favored her older Brother, and her Father is a heavy drinker. She's been homeless multiple times. She has a Husband that has no concept of how to be one or a Father for that matter, he’s unreliable and always disappearing even though he comes from a stable well off family. She won’t stop trying to help him though he does nothing for her or their children. She just had her third child four months ago that came with complications. All the while she is stuck living in a house that is too small for her family. I should mention that her parents live with her as well, that’s why they are unable to help me do anything for her Birthday this year. I'd like to do something special for her after all that she has been through these last few years. She helped supply me with everything I needed for my first child when I had no one else. She is a 'give anyone the shirt off of her back' type of person and is always quick to assist others. She deserves to have someone do something nice for her for a change and since she doesn't have a Reddit account I thought that I would send out a line on her behalf. If anyone here can help to surprise her with a PapaJ's gift card for her Birthday, St. Patrick's Day, that would be amazing. They have excellent coupons for our area and a cookie pie, which would be great because she doesn't like cake. Thanks for any help!

Tired college student, walked 6.4 miles home because ride left without me
Hey guys, I was wondering if someone would be so kind as to provide me with a pizza today. Basically, today I had a 9:30am class that normally lets out around 10:45 (supposed to be at 11) and normally a friend from another class drives me home. Well I guess he didn't feel like waiting for me today and he told me to just walk home. Well it was surprisingly humid and hot today for some reason (I live in Houston, TX) and that walk was tremendously exhausting. I got home about 15 minutes ago (around 1:10 or so). A pizza to go with my aching feet would be awesome! If any of you could help out, it would be great.

tl;dr - ride left without me, took me over 2 hours to walk back home, kinda tired, want

Aussie would love a real meal instead of bread
Someone was nice enough in the past and hoping to find a kind person again.

Australian, living on disability pension having trouble keeping up with bills and debt from before things went to shit.

Currently living off frozen bread (yay for $1 loaves of bread) would just love a real meal as it's been weeks since I had a good feed.

Got plenty of coupons for places (as buying pizza without coupons in Aus is insane), www.dominos.com.au accept international CC or paypal and www.pizzahut.com.au accept international CC, both have timed orders (god I hate timezones).

Any help would be amazing.

Crackers and Chips are not enough.
So I live with family and don't have a job(yet, third interview with Whole Foods tomorrow and I'm sure I got it) and they've asked that I stop eating their food. Since they never offer me any I don't know how I'm supposed to survive since I'm basically not allowed to eat. In the past 3 days I've had 2 sleeves of Ritz Crackers, a bag of hotfries my sister gave me, and 2 Egg Salad Sandwiches my sister gave me. I'm also unsure if its even ok for me to take my medication with an empty stomach.

As the title says, my daughter of a month is really sick and the doctors can't figure out why, my car died and I haven't been able to work at my delivery job. So I'm left with pennies and cant even afford the hospital food.

A little pizza goes a long way
I was laid off from my halfway decent job back in October and had been looking for work ever since while my savings has dwindled to nothing. I did FINALLY get another job this month and have been working my butt off since, but payday isn't until next week and I've been living off of beans and rice for a very long time. I'd love to celebrate the new job with a pizza, and will pay it forward as soon as I can. Thanks for taking the time to even read this, and if there is someone with more need of a pizza then please give it to them first, I'm by no means starving.

Had a pretty rough week. Want to drown my sorrows in a pizza.
long story short; girl I was with for 5 years ended up being toxic to my life. she had been cheating since 2013 and I eventually uncovered a whole mole hill of information on her and her lying ass. I am devastated but I do not show it. That's an awful lot of time to throw away for something so petty. I want to drown my sorrows by eating a pizza. It's my comfort food and always reminds me of new york city, where I originally came from. If anyone could help me out, I would be beyond appreciative.

I was planning on going skiing today.  My girlfriend lives within walking distance of the bus station so I got a ride from her and was planning on walking over from her place to catch the bus.  I realized that I forgot my wallet at home though so now I'm stuck with no food and more importantly no skiing :(

It's no big deal if you would rather help out somebody else; I'm just stuck for a few hours and figured I'd try my luck.

I got a call today from my dog's vet; his cancer prognosis... well, it's not good. I don't feel like doing anything, including cooking. A pizza would be fantastic
Like the title says. I've known that my dog had a carcinoma for a week or so. I expected, however, that radiation would fix him right up. Yeah...no.... apparently he has some super weird tumor that no one has seen and their best guess is that with treatment clinical symptoms will restart in ~9 months and then metastasis will take over, and then, well, it's self explanatory. 

So, as you can imagine, I feel like shit. I don't want to cook. I don't want to go out to eat. I could manage to drive to the pizza place and pick up the pizza (the little place in town doesn't deliver), and I have to save every penny for chemo for my best friend. 

I'm sorry for the long story. This is still recent news to me and it feels raw. 

Anywho, if you can help me out with a pizza, I'll be forever in your debt.

The past few weeks have been kinda rough for my gf and I, a pie would totally cheer us both up. Will pay it back/forward!!!
Or I'll donate 1.5x the amount spent on pizza in your name to a charity of your choice!

I am broke with a dollar and some change in my bank account, could really use a pizza for dinner!
Had a rough couple of pay periods with low hours with ended up screwing me up pretty bad financially. I just paid for the last month of rent at the place I am staying at then moving in with the parents to rebuild my finances to get back on me feet. I literally have a $1.xx in my bank account and all of my credit cards are maxed out. I'm starving and a pizza would be awesome! I will return the favor when I get paid later next week!

I'll provide proof if necessary!

broke dad with hungry wife
Well I'm a new father and my breast feeding wife seems to be starving to death, her words not mine. Problem is I'm completely broke and don't get paid till next Friday, I'm borrowing money from my parents to hold me over but being able to get her a pizza would be amazing. If anyone wants to be out hero she'd love you forever.

Had a big fight with family, feeling down and only have $6 until my next paycheck.
Had a big fight with my family. Feeling pretty under the weather and hungry. Not getting paid until next week and only have $1.67 in the bank. (Paying off past medical bills suck... Why do paramedic van rides across a few blocks cost so much?!) A pizza would help me out very much. Thanks. 


Edit: Corrected dollars... wow that paramedic's bill just absolutely screwed me. It all makes sense now. They're trying to cause me a heart attack to get me back in. I see your game. /joke 2nd Edit: Bought a loaf of bread.

broke from uninsured medical expenses and a family in crisis


Hey guys, I mostly use reddit to complain about movies, so I shouldn't have too much info that can personally identify me. I work as a sub teacher so my cashflow is pretty non existent as it is. Lately I've had to pay $1000 out of pocket for new special contact lenses. I have a cornea problem called keratoconus that kinda stinks. Also, my parents are pretty young but have had a real run of bad luck. My dad screwed up his back, his surgeon screwed it up worse (fused the wrong vertebrae!) and he ended up losing his job. 

Anyway I'm penniless for probably another month. Still trying to catch up from all the days off in winter...now we're getting snow days!  :(


Plus I'm getting an infected tooth pulled tomorrow, as I didn't have insurance til last year and uninsured dental work is insane. So I'm on amoxicillin and need to get crap in my stomach. Been rationing out the last of my pantry. Finished off my last box of brown rice the other day and ate a can of cranberry sauce for dinner last night. 


This is all true. Please laugh at me. I'm not depressed or anything but holy crap am I hungry. I did get pizzad once over a year ago under several of the same circumstances and paid it forward. 
**EDIT: my pizza fairy's order didn't work, and he hasn't been back on reddit all day. If anyone can still help, I'll regift the other Pizza gift cert to you/whoever u want if it ever shows up. Also I might have a Steam game or two to trade. I haven't used it much but my little brother has gotten me into buying a bunch of stuff I never play during the sales. **

Broke after moving and paying deposits...paycheck is almost two weeks late. Wife and I would love a pizza!
We're both freelancers in a photography studio for a large company, UNFORTUNATELY we occasionally get paid LATE. This is very poor timing as we have just spent a lot on moving/bill deposits, etc.
We can pay it forward later this week. We live in Louisville, KY.

Hungry and short on pocket money. Also, giving out RTF flair, and stirring up a /r/conspiracy hornets nest. See inside!
I'm giving out /r/RandomTrueFacts flairs to anyone who does any of the following: * comments in this thread with a True Fact * tweets a previously posted [Random True Fact](/r/RandomTrueFacts) with the hashtag #modtalkleaks (you need to either comment here with the link or PM it to me) * comments in the inevitable SRD thread with a True Fact As before, you may not like the flair you get. However this time, 8chan is watching my account, so by doing this, you're all going to a part of a massive conspiracy! It should be hilarious. Incidentally, I'm also hungry, would like pizza, and am short on pocket money. So if you'd like a central role in my shill conspiracy, buy me a pizza! /me waves to SRD!

I won my first amateur muay thai fight yesturday, so I'm finally done with an intense low carb diet.
Since November I've been dieting heavily to drop enough pounds to fight at an appropriate weight. I ended up dropped 33 pounds for the fight. Yesturday I killed all the Waffle cravings I had and today I'm trying to get a good taste of some pineapple and pepperoni pizza to really end this diet well. I did like the weight I lost for the fight so I'm going to try and stay healthy, eat better and continue to exercise as much as I did for my fight. In the meantime though, I'm just trying to fulfill these craving I've been having for the last 4 months.

Wife vanished in the middle of the night with new bf, then took all money and sold my stuff after I reacted poorly and was in the hospital for a suicide attempt.
Long story short, I have nothing. She even took the Netflix and Hulu accounts. My phone is getting shut off in a few days and she took the car as well. I was a full time student but was in the hospital too long to get it back together and had to withdraw to preserve my GPA. 

I'm still hanging by a thread and would really really appreciate if I could think clearly past the pain in my stomach.

Help us get a (really) good grade in data mining!
Hey r/RAOP. My teammates and I are doing a presentation this Wednesday on you guys and your community. We Started with the [competition idea from Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza).

Here is a [small sample from our report](http://i.imgur.com/soxFIDc.png) we're putting together

What would *really* make our presentation shine would be 4 or 5 pizzas showing up right as we're going over our conclusions and analysis. (20 minute presentation starts Wednesday 3/11@11:00am PST)

Our grade situation isn't hurting, but we figured that mentioning ourselves to you would help offset any unforseen damages. If you know what I mean.

If you guys are interested in seeing our final report, we don't mind sharing our results with you when we're done.

Thank you in advance Reddit!! The community you have built here is one of the bright spots on the internet.

So today is my first day off in I don't know how long. Looking to have some Pizza for dinner. I can't leave the house because it's just me and my grandpa for the next few days so I can't leave him unattended. If anyone would be willing to help out I'd appreciate it so much! I get paid on Wednesday and will be able to get some groceries for us then. Thanks for even taking the time to read this! If you can't help it's okay I understand! I live in Central FLA if that helps anyone.

I'm tired of eating chicken fingers.
I recently got a job last week, finally. Sadly, it'll be two more weeks until I get my first salary. I've been eating a five year old's diet of chicken fingers, nuggets and any other processed shape chicken for quite sometime. I'd love to literally kill for some grown up pizza right now... The spinach.. 

If anyone can help me out with a small pizza, I'd be forever grateful. Don't get me wrong, fishsticks, chicken nuggets, french fries and pb&amp;j's are great..... but you can only eat so much!

He just left... drown my sorrows with cheese and red sauce... (I'm actually hungry)
So, long story short... my BF of 9 years just got into a car with another (much younger) boy and they drove off together. Tomorrow he is flying to Europe to meet ANOTHER boy... he's been busy. Anyway, the details aren't important... I'm an emotional WRECK. The worst part is that I haven't been able to work for the last 2 weeks because I have a very stressful job and I had to take a leave of absence to deal with all these issues I've been having with my BF. So, I have no money for the next 2 weeks... (yeah, he left me with no money too)... A pizza would be extremely comforting to have right now if I could afford it. Thanks. **UPDATE** My work just called me, they denied my leave of absence... I just got fired. Lovely.

Hungry, but see the light at the end of the tunnel.
Lost my job when the business I was working for went under last month, been struggling ever since. But finally I got a new job just in the nick of time since I'm completely out of money. All the rest of my money has gone into gas for driving around looking for a job. Scraped and bought all the ramen I could with the coins around the house and finally ran out of that. Could definitely use a pizza to get me through the next few days before I start, and luckily it's a food joint so I will hopefully be able to manage some food from there. Will definitely pay it forward in a few weeks when I'm back on my feet. Thanks!

Honolulu: Ran out of bread, eating rice with ketchup is dreadful. Halp.
Loaf of bread I bought is gone. Never have I been so sad to not have bread. Good news. I got ketchup, wasabi, mustard, fish sauce, couple of cheap spices and rice. So I got that going for me, which is nice. Halp.

Edit: Yes, I live here. No, I'm not on vacation begging for food. Seriously, its not paradise on earth if you LIVE here. Visiting is great but even then I would go to Maui instead. Thanks for the PMs though...

Broke and hungry UK student
Hi all,

I'm sitting in my student flat in Liverpool with bare cupboards and £0.40 to my name and I'm starving. Tomorrow I'm going back home with a lift from my mum but right now I'm super hungry and have no real way of fixing that. I hate asking for help but here I am with little other option.

Thankyou for reading!

EDIT: Still hungry and cold... I know I'm something of a lurker but I'd be eternally grateful and more than happy to pay it forwards.

Will draw for pizza.
I'm an artist (not a very good one, but an artist nonetheless) who would love a pizza. Problem is, my commissions aren't open at the moment, due to lack of time on my part. I have some time today, and I'm very hungry. I can draw you anything you want, as long as it isn't too terribly detailed. I'll start the drawing when you PM me, and give it to you once the pizza is ordered. &lt;3

Sick and hungry; will make custom jewelry for food :)
Hi all. I've been battling the same upper respiratory BS for a week and a half, and am dead inside and miserable. I've got no food in the house and no funds, and would really like something tasty to eat. Leftovers can last me days. In return, I will make you custom one-of-a-kind jewelry and shiny things. Hoping for a Pizza Hut ecard (I literally have 4 cents, a card is the only way I can tip the delivery driver). I'm in WA state, US.

You can see examples of my jewelry work here;

Prevent another box of Mac'n'Cheese and prove the power of Reddit to my roomie. [x-post from /r/RandomActsOfPizza
It begins like this, I'm a student at the University of Oklahoma and I am currently broke. Partly because one of my two roommates hasn't been pulling her weight on the bills, telling the two of us she doesn't think she has to since she's at her boyfriend's all the time. That's neither here nor there.

The point is I found this subreddit and mentioned trying it to the good roommate and he doesn't think anything will come of it. So I'd like to break up the monotony of my current diet of boxed mac and prove him wrong.

So what do you guys say? Can we feed me and him, either from Dominoes, Pizza Hut, or Papa Johns (in order by distance)?
Should this work I promise to #PizzaItForward twice, when I can and wear a "Thanks /u/Username" picture on my twitter account for a week.

UK - The tribe has descended into anarchy
It's only been a few hours since the tribe mother left in search of better lands for our tribe, yet the tribe has descended into anarchy.

I have reason to believe the smallest tribe members are planning to rid themselves of their current tribe leader, me, they have found weapons of the civilised men. Weapons of steel that howl louder than wolves and breath fire hotter than that of the mountain. We've also managed to upset the tribe spirit, it is angry and feels betrayed by the sudden change in leadership and I have no pizza to offer as a ceremonial sacrifice.

I have found a device the civilised men use to communicate and have made a magic picture of the spirit.

Title. It's sunday so all the banks are closed and I would just like some pizza. I'm not a broke student or anything, just a little unlucky today. Please and thanks.

Only $4 for two weeks, asking for help with food.
After all of the bills, I am left with $4 for two weeks until my paycheck. I don't have enough for groceries and would really like a pizza. I can budget a pizza for a week and a half, so that would help me a lot until my next paycheck. Thank you.

UK - I am but a man with a pizza shaped hole.
Or a circular hole. Well, a hole in a sort of lake shape that the stomach is. But Pizza is malleable, So this could work!

Ramblings aside, I'd be grateful for a Pizza, I'm not doing much with my evening either if you want something in return? Suggestions welcome? Haha.

Thanks for looking!

I've only eaten one meal in two days - Tucson, AZ
Hi there. My name's DeMei and I'm a freelance writer. I'm currently waiting on payment from a client of mine, but she hasn't gotten back to me in two days.
I've been homeless for almost a month now, so everyday has been a struggle... but hopefully I'll be in a new place by my bday on the 25th. Keep your fingers crossed for me!
Anyways, I had a bowl of rice with some chard yesterday. Two days before, I had some Frosted Flakes. There's a Pizza Hut &amp; Papa John's in walking distance and I would be the luckiest girl ever if someone helped me out with a pizza pie. I'd be sure to return the favor as soon as possible. Thanks for reading.

Law student that would really just love a pizza tonight...
I don't really have a sob story. I'm a law student studying for finals and don't have cash or time/energy to cook. A pizza would let me keep studying and give me something delicious to go along with it.

I'm in the Seattle area. Thanks!

I have hit financial rock bottom. Check pics inside to see why :(
Shattered my ankle in the worst way possible(bimalleolar fracture) on Dec 1st while attending my best friends dads funeral.  Still unable to work due to the severity of the break.  My savings is gone, down to 89 cents in my bank account.  Haven't eaten in two days.  I live in Chicago and a small cheese pizza would be such a blessing at this moment in time!!!

Check out these pics for "proof" if you would like but be forewarned that it isn't pretty. [NSFL](http://imgur.com/S5fI2GF,zQNEOjN)  First picture is the night it happened.  The 2nd picture is 3 days after surgery with my new titanium "hardware".  I promise 6 months from now once I am back on my feet, quite literally, I would pay it forward 5 fold.  Help a starving gimp survive!!!

Broke College Student could really use some pizza
Basically I'm broke and on top of it I've had a pretty shitty day so some pizza could seriously make things a bit better, I think I'd handle it all better with some food in my stomach anyway. I'd be willing to trade art for pizza, if anyone is interested, I can link some examples.

Whats the only thing worse than being a college student with homework during spring break...
Being a broke college student with homework during student break.

Honestly, my rent is paid, my bills are paid, but otherwise I am broke. I'm sure I could scrap enough up for some ramen, but it would definable help to both fill the stomach and keep my spirits up studying for my big Japanese test after spring break, and working in the studio on my mixed media project.

(for Sun 22nd)] A steaming hot pizza for a 24hr Charity gaming stream...
On Sunday/Monday (22nd/23rd) I'll be doing a 24 hr. gaming stream for charity. As it strands at the moment, I'm about £300 short for my rent this Month, so I don't have any money for my rent due Friday either, but none the less, I'm soldering on as I've had this organized for Months.

(Just as a side note, the money won't be going to me, it goes straight to the charity, so this isn't a scum for me trying to raise money for my rent)

It would be brilliant if I could arrange with someone to have a pizza delivered whilst I'm doing the stream, of course, said redditor would get a massive shout-out!!

Links for proof.

It's been a rough day and I can't deal with it
I normally can rough it out but sometimes the reality of living on $800 a month and almost all of that going to rent/basic needs catches up to me. I'm not picky and when I'm better off I'll give back.

Low on funds :( Pizza please?
Well, the story goes like this. Basically I didn't get my little cousin a birthday present about 2 weeks ago and I felt really bad about it and I know she loves Ariana Grande, so I spent most of my extra spending cash getting her 2 tickets to her performance tomorrow at the Rodeo in Houston (one for her and one for a friend). I thought I had more money than what I do, but I currently only have $3.56 in my bank account and payday is still a couple of days away.

tl;dr - no money for food til friday, would like a pizza, will pay it forward

Been on the job search for awhile
Just had a phone call with Walmart that has ended my two month spell of no one calling me back about an interview and i have one tomorrow. Tired of asking my father and my sister for any kind of help so getting a pizza would be awesome. I would be stretching it out for like three days, i am also trying to sell my paintball gun to get some cash so hopefully that happens before i run out of pizza. After i nail this interview and get some cash flow i will definitely be helping out others that need some pizza. Will even repay helper with a pizza first. If no one helps it's all good :) can't always expect help. I know that's the way the dice rolls.

College students looking for some pizza
Currently attending a university, and as you all know, spring break is coming up very soon... you know what that means - Midterms. Friends and I are staying up late studying tonight to study, as well as all day tomorrow (day off, as we have no classes). 

Long story short, myself and my 3 friends are all broke and would appreciate eating something other than some frozen burritos from Walmart, and Ramen. :]

-From CO, by the way.

Sonnets from the Pizzeria (with respect to Elizabeth Barrett Browning)
How do I love my pizza? Let me say.
I love it hot and fresh on a cold night.
I love it cold by morning's bright daylight.
Cheese and pepperoni is the best way, 
But most other meats are welcome to stay.
Keep those anchovies well out of my sight,
Pineapple on pizza just isn't quite right
And veggies are nasty, keep them away.

New York style is the absolute best,
But it's hard to find on the Crystal Coast,
So I must pick and choose from all the rest. 
Pizza Hut always lives up to their boast,
And Papa Johns also passes the test,
But Dominos brings it to my home post.

EDIT: tried to get it to be in proper octet, sextet form - it wouldn't cooperate.

I would like one last pizza, before I change my life for the better.

I'm 6ft and 195 lbs and I plan on losing weight and being more fit.

If I receive this pizza, I will post pictures of my journey, I will make a bond to whoever gives me this pizza, that I will get in shape. 

You have my word. 

And i'll also return the favor!

I will buy you something on Amazon worth ten dollars more than a pizza in exchange for a pizza.
So I'm broke but have about money in my Amazon gift card account. I can't transer the gift card balance but if you buy me a pizza (i think getting a Domino's gift card will be easiest) I will buy you an item of equal or up to 10 dollars more than the cost of the pizza and ship it to your home.

Boyfriend dumped me, 2 weeks till next paycheck, all my food is at his apartment.
First time poster. I already know sob stories don't bode well here.

The situation is what it is. My boyfriend dumped me, I don't get paid in two weeks, and I left all my food and cookware at his apartment.

I literally left in the middle of the night, 2am with all my clothes and everything I could think of bringing, and left...without thinking about the fact I'd have no food or anything to cook with at my apartment. I don't even want to see him. I'd rather starve right now that get my cookware from him.

Would anyone be cool to buy me a pizza? I could use not only a pick-me-up, but something I can pack with me for lunch for the remaining of the week.

- Norman, OK -- second attempt, I'd just like to see this work once.
Three days ago I posted a request, and /u/whynotdrew rose to the occasion. Thank you. Unfortunately due to things beyond both of our control I never got the gift card and never got the pizza. While my original post was about proving to my roommate RAOP works, and breaking up the monotony of mac 'n' cheese, only the later has happened as I've sustained myself on Cheerios and random gleanings from the roommate's stash of ramen. For that reason, I'd like to ask for one more shot at this. As with my last post my giver will have a thank you note featuring their username as my Twitter profile pic for a week, and I will Pizza-it-forward twice when I can. Thank you all.

I am a dumb idiot who left her lunch at home!
I'm working a long shift today and I left my lunch sitting on the kitchen counter because of course I did! At least the dog will be happy. I'm sure he'll loooove the leftover stew.

Anyway. I just paid all my bills and have 11 cents in my bank account and zero cash until I get paid on Friday. I will gladly exchange a pizza for a plethora of pictures of my cats and dog and bearded dragon and tarantulas (if you're into that) but unfortunately that's all I have to give at the moment. Though whether I get a pizza today or not, I absolutely want to offer one up when I get paid on Friday so I suppose if I get one today, that would be me paying it forward. :)

I used this before and had someone really help me out. I hate to do this again but we are all very hungry and have no money right now to afford food because of gas to get to and from work &amp; school. We live in the United States.

I'm actually starving. I will pay it forward.
I've been broke for the past week, but I've managed to get at least a sandwich each day, until yesterday/today.  I haven't  been able to eat in the past 2 days. My last check was way too low,and I was unprepared. I get paid tomorrow, but I've reached my hunger threshold.  I'm not one to let a good deed go without paying it forward.  If someone helps me out this time, I will help someone out the very next chance I get.  It's a promise.

I'd really appreciate a pizza. I'm stuck at work over spring break which I'd normally avoid but I desperately need to save money to make rent. I'm sick of my own cooking and trying not to beat myself up over the fun I'm missing out on. Also, domino's is 50% off right now. So even if you skip me over, keep that in mind when ordering for others! Thanks

Having a pretty terrible day, could use a pizza.
My sob story: Besides being horribly depressed, I'm currently stuck at work 2 hours after I should have left because my ride didn't tell me they were going... and my checking account is frozen so I can't order a cab or have anything but frozen chicken or rice-a-roni for dinner if I do manage to find a way home.

Some fattening food made primarily of bread and cheese would probably make feel a lot better in any circumstance.

No sob story, looking to celebrate actually, in the US
Well I'm in my freshman year of college and that means I'm on Spring Break and just did midterms last week. Finally got my math midterm grade and I got an A-! If I can keep this up, I can make the Dean's List AND skip the next math class to go up a level! Super stoked about how well I'm doing and I'd love to celebrate with a nice hot pizza instead of boring old ramen if any stranger wouldn't mind making that a reality! I can also provide proof of this if someone really wanted, so that'd be no problem.

Hey guys. I've never done this before. I had to take my car into the shop for some maintenance and I will be without a car for two days. A pizza would be great so I can spread it out for a few meals.

Hey! It has been such an amazing week I would like to celebrate a little bit. I finally got my new job working down at a convenient store (It's a start :P), Managed to get an awesome sub reddit up and running to help the gaming community a bit, and also bumped all my grade up above a B average which is a pretty big deal for me.

Hi,

In Kansas City, MO, U.S. of A.

So... me and the wife are hungry. Got nothing but dried beans in the pantry and half a stick of butter in the fridge. A mouse hung himself in there earlier :-)

We get money tomorrow, but today we are hungry and broke.

How come so broke? Had A LOT of bills to pay this month, and we just had a baby girl a couple of weeks ago. 

I have bought pizza for others, and will pay it forward again. Any help you can give would be awesome and apriciated

Pizza is, without a doubt, the food of the gods.
"All pizza's deliver divine, rich, cheesy, mouthwatering experiences that hustle your brains pleasure centers into overdrive." - I got this awesome quote from a [video explaining how pizza reacts to chemicals...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOkCgAwhh9U) ...now I'm really hungry. My younger brother, my mom, and I are living on scraps the last few days, and the scraps are now depleted. We've already hit up the food bank last week and they treated my family like a bunch of Neanderthals waiting in line to get a loaf of week-old bread-rolls. I promise to pay-it-forward to a /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza family. PS... My brother and Mom say 'Hi Reddit' (they don't use computers very much, lol) PSS.. we live in Washington state

Had the flu all week, feeling very blah, pizza would be nice
I've had a particularly bad bout of the flu and I'm still miserable but I seem to finally have recovered my appetite and I'm sick of soup and ham sandwiches. My boyfriend has already been amazing and run to the store for me several times despite having to work really long hours this week. Also things have just generally not being going great the last few weeks, but I won't bore you with the details. 

It would be great if we had a pizza to share.

Florida.Depressed, missed work due to bike breaking, starving.
TL;DR Bike broke, missed work, afraid of losing job after being sick last week, spent money on a little buddy to help with depression and some necessities for him and forgot all about my food needs.

I just want to be fat today and play with Winchester and pray I have a job when I get in tomorrow.

Would just like a break really.
Been working on getting my life back to normal after some heavy things and part of that was starting on antidepressants. I've been having a really hard time with them because I'm having an opposite side effect. According to my doctor they're supposed to give me more energy, but instead they sapped every last bit and I've been reduced to falling asleep on the couch several times a week for the last month and a half. 

I'm really feeling it today and figuring out dinner tonight just sounds so hard at this point. 

It would be much appreciated if I woke up to the pizza dude/gal ringing the doorbell.

Also happy first day of spring to everyone! 

For anyone who's curious my submission history will show I've both gifted and received once.

Edit: my bf just called me miserable saying that he's staying home from work today sick. I hope I can bring him pizza when I get off work.

My life is amazing and getting more amazing, but I haven't been able to get a pizza in months.
I got back to work freelancing in January. Life is good overall: Work is picking up, I have an amazing girlfriend, I love my apartment.

But things are still extremely tight. I can't afford a car yet. My bank account hovers in the low double digits. It won't always be that way, but that's the way right now. I keep myself psyched, focus on the future.

I haven't been able to afford a pizza in months and would love to indulge in one's cheese melty goodness. Right now I have some rice and peanut butter and peanuts and hot sauce - which makes a surprisingly tasty meal together (seriously, try it), but I won't have groceries until next week.

If you are a so-inclined and kind-hearted redditor, a pizza would really make my weekend.

Have a great day.

Eating alone tonight. Would be grateful for a pizza.
I'll save you all my life/money/etc sucks sob story. For tonight I simply just don't like cooking if it's only for myself. No motivation. Cooking is always more rewarding if someone else is there to enjoy it. :) But seriously a pizza would not only boost my spirits but would save me some trouble! I'm in Minnesota and have all the majors in my area (Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, and Dominos). Thanks in advance to any kind person who happens to decide to make my day.

Got tooth pulled last week. Just got off amoxicillin and feeling like crap (4x a day last 2 weeks). Meanwhile my dad lost his job because his shitty surgeon fused the wrong vertebrae. On the positive end my transfer application to Rutgers was accepted!

No money for awhile so a pizza would help. Will make it last and def pay it forward next month.

[Upstate, NY] Friend down on his luck, would like to help him out.
My friend has been living out his car the last couple months. Was supposed to travel out of town to see some family, got pulled over and due to some issues got his car towed away. Now he's carless, homeless and really down on his luck. We're both broke but I'm planning on having him over to cheer him up and it'd be nice if I could give him a pizza.

If anyone would like to extend their kindness, I would truly appreciate it. (Will def pay it forward come payday) Thanks!

Hi guys,

So I was supposed to be going to a friend's wedding reception this evening but due to some financial miscalculation and thinking it was next week, I am unable to go.

Literally 10 minutes after agreeing to look after my 4 year old nephew, I had 3 messages offering to lend/pay for me to go.  Obviously I couldn't let my sister down so now I'm home, bored and slightly sad.

Any pizza would be appreciated, I'll pay it forward on pay day (31st March).  Feeeding myself and a 4 year old chaos engine.

Thanks
J

The Request
It was about 2AM, and I had just gotten home from a night of working at the local gas station, a Phillips 66 that could use some TLC. If you’ve ever worked in a gas station, especially the late shift, you’re used to seeing some of the stranger people come in and out. From tall, broody men dressed in full leopard print 3-piece suits to the occasional triple amputee coming in to get horrible gas station nachos. Nothing really surprises you from the people you meet on a day to day basis. In fact you start to admire the less mundane as a sort of release from the pressures of everyday expectations. Either way, even if I wasn’t tired of the people, I was tired of the gas station footlongs I had been subsiding on. I was running low on cash and my payday was miles away. I decided to hop onto my crappy phone and search some local pizza deals. Nothing too surprising, the standard 25%  off or the absurd 5 medium pizzas for $6.99 each. My wallet wasn’t exactly happy, but then I was craving something above my paygrade of Red Baron. Googling around I managed my way to find the Random Acts website, which seemed like quite the blessing. I tossed around in my head the idea I was even worth requesting for. I saw a few members unabashedly saying “no sob story, just want a pizza.” I was taken aback but not really surprised. Who could be? Still it gave me enough bravado to request given my situation. So I posted some menial story about my night and wanting a pizza to diversify my palette of expired Fritos and gas station burritos. I was surprised when I got a response so quickly, not only that, but the person seemed to recognize my location. A bit cautious, but a bit more hungry, I asked the fellow what he had in mind and if a local place would be okay for pick-up. He convinced me a no-name restaurant nearby was the way to go and he could call in a pick-up order for me if I were willing to drive there. I luckily had a half-tank of gas and was in no hurry to go to sleep so I accepted. I bit foolish in retrospect, but I drove my way to the place, a Pizarro’s Pizza off the highway. Just an innocuous location the offerer assured me was the best. In this case I didn’t even think about how late it was and if this location would even be accepting orders. By the time I got there the lights were out. I decided to get out of my car, check it out, and check my phone to see if I’d got the location wrong. No luck, the address was the same. I was about to return to my car when I noticed something odd. A single station wagon with the delivery tag on their hood sat lit off the side. Certainly no coincidence, I started walking towards the car and received a message saying they were sorry, they cooked it up for me and had to close so the offerer waited behind for me to arrive. I’m fairly gullible and accepted this person’s sort of outrageous giving nature as the reason they were on the site in the first place. So I walked up to the car, their window rolled. A man with a local sports team’s hoodie obscuring his face handed me the still warm pizza box and some breadsticks, which I thought was very kind to add. We chatted a moment about the gas station and spooky incident as he got a call and said he had to make his way. It was getting late and my tummy was grumbling, so I went to my car and made my way back to my crumby apartment gnawing on a breadstick. As I got home, I got into my PJs and ready to watch some Star Trek on the Netflix account I’m borrowing. I grabbed a plate and a breadstick and opened the box. It wasn’t a pepperoni as I was expecting, but some strange meat I didn’t recognize until a moment later. It was a human ear, and another, and another. I panicked and threw the box away from me. I called the police and they came to confiscate the evidence. I told them about the Reddit post and the usernames and the messages, a crumb trail that ended up nowhere. Not even the pizza shop recognized the car as I described it. In the end nothing came up, and a month later I found myself on Reddit again only to see another fellow in my area of Texas asking if people wanted to come over for a Pizarro’s Pizza at 2 in the morning, I wondered, could it be? ----------------------------------- Hey, I’m not a fiction-writer by trade, but if you liked my story - I’d really love a Papa Johns pizza tonight, I'm in the US. If you didn’t like my story, why did you read so much silly!? Anyway, stay safe out there.

Sis and I are home alone and hungry for Pizza.
Hey all,

I have posted a request here before but we got no response in time. Its the same situation again where my sis and I are home and parents won't be back until tomorrow morning. We've had a bonding kind of day and I would like to top it off with some good Pizza. I want to show her that people of the internet are willing to do some nice things for each other. So if you guys are willing to do this for us, let me know! :)

Preferable Pizza would be Dominos.

Looking forward to hearing back from you guys. :) Have a good rest of the day/night haha.

Soon-to-be college graduate craving a pizza for dinner
I just completed my senior exit exam and am craving a pizza for dinner tonight, instead of Chef Boyardee. Moving into a new apartment on Friday has left me low on money in the bank with rent due on the 1st. I'd love to eat a small pizza tonight instead of another can of Chef Boyardee.

I'll be paying it forwards to another college grad very soon, because I'll have been here and sometimes it feels good to just eat a pizza.

Looking to trade Restaurant.com gift card of your choice for some pie (Los Angeles, CA)
So I worked a gig that finished up early and as a bonus for finishing up early we were given a $500 gift card to Restaurant.com (since they were one of the sponsors of the event I was cutting). It's awesome and I've bought a few gift cards off there but I'm not looking to go anywhere tonight so I figured I'd see if anyone is looking to trade.

Restaurant.com works where you pay $5 for a $10 gift card (or $15 for $25 etc.) and it basically gets you half off your meal. Sounds kind of confusing, I know, but the website explains it a bit better. So if you see anything you want on there PM me and we can trade for pizza.

Friend of mine says they have never had pizza before and I want to pop his pizza cherry.
I have a friend who comes from a household that has a very restrictive diet (The house diet is a all natural raw foods type of thing) and they recently moved out and are living on their own. Since they moved out they are slowly trying new things and I want to be the one who gives them their first pizza before they get it themselves. Only problem is I am broke right now and can't really afford to get them a pizza right now. If anyone would like to help me out it would be greatly appreciated and I will pay it forward when I can!

I've been working 10 hour days, 7 days a week for the past month. I'm exausted, over worked, severely underpaid via salary, and worst of all, my relationship of 2.5 years just ended last week. I looked forward to my Cake Day since I found out what it is. Its my very first one, and I'm working, down in the dumps, and to top it off, its raining. Idk. I guess this is just a little thing that would be fun to have today....just so I don't feel so blue....

College student home for Spring Break - watching my 7 year old sister and her friend all day today. Would appreciate a pizza to share with them! Will offer in exchange a picture of all of us enjoying the pizza.
As title says, I'm home for spring break from school and it's also my little sisters break, so I'm staying in this whole week watching her while my parents both work late. Her friend is over too and I'd like to feed them some pizza! We can all take a picture together with the pizza if someone's willing to send one over. :)

my dog has been diagnosed with cancer of the lymph nodes. Terribly upset, would be nice to have a pie of any type.
My dogs name was wishbone. She was a jack russell terrier. Nearing 15 years of a great life, and suddenly stricken down. Started last sunday. Face got all puffy, she suddenly started getting all sensitive. This sucks :(. We have an appointment to put her out of her misery so she won't be in pain. I plan to go in to the veterinarian's office with her, to be with her until the end of her days.

New apartment, empty fridge and in a celebratory mood. Feed a couple Californians?
I've been homeless for a majority of the last year. I picked up a job and started saving money and searching for an apartment to get off the streets. Sadly my little brother lost his job and was going to lose his apartment in a place I was trying to move into. Luckily she let us exchange it instead of putting me on a waiting list. (Not upscale, just gated in a bad area... murder just a couple weeks ago) Well he just got a new management position and I want to celebrate with him but I don't get paid for a couple weeks and don't have any means of borrowing the money to take him out yet. 

A while back I had received a couple pizzas from here when I was down on my luck and planned to pay it forward when things got better. But they became worse. Finally things are starting to look up for me, I know I'm requesting but it won't be long before I'm offering. 

Will be home from work just before 6pmpst let me know if it's possible.

Thank you.

Birthday present went all wrong! - UK
Hey /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza  

I hope you're all keeping well! 
  
  
So today is my 24th birthday and one of my close friends from home knows how much I enjoy pizza and decided to order two for me from Dominos. He waited for me to get home before ordering it and told me it will be a surprise. Great, I thought!  

40 mins later I have the bell ring with the Domino's delivery guy telling me they are really busy but did manage to write me a birthday message on the box. So there I am, super excited running back to the kitchen ready to unbox and demolish this meal when I suddenly find **BACON!** written on the side *both* pizzas. It's in the crust, in the filling and generally just bacon *everywhere*.  

  

I spoke to the local store which delivered it and explained the situation to them but they wouldn't refund/exchange them. So in turn I found the local customer service number, but they won't pick up/respond to any voicemails.  

  
  

Now I am stuck with two bacon-overloaded pizzas and nobody locally around willing to take them and a customer service team that won't respond/answer my calls.  
  
  
Would anyone like to help me out here? What I am proposing is to go out and give two local homeless people pizzas in exchange for two bacon-less pizzas from a RAOP'er.

  

Any takers?

Today's my 27th birthday, husband's been away on work and won't be back til next week.
Some drama with my narcissistic mother also occurred. We had dinner plans for today, but I'm not really up for spending time with her after the things she said. I'll be alone with my cats, video games, and current crochet projects.

I live in Tacoma and would be more than happy with one of those dinner boxes from Pizza Hut with the two mediums. They can easily last me 3-4 days. Thank you in advance :D

Money stolen!
My money that I had to last me for the next couple weeks was stolen from me today while I was at the gym. Things are tight for my family and I right now and we are looking at no dinner right now. Anything can help and would be amazing.

Very Hungry college student!
Hello! I've never used this before, though I've always wanted to be able to do something like this for someone else when I had the money- unfortunately, that time isn't right now. Due to medical bills(I have intenstinal problems, a faulty gallbladder and godknows what else), costs of medication and bills skyrocketing, I'm down to my last few dollars and I don't have anything in my cupboards but a can of beans, and I can't even eat them due to my IBS. I /can/ have pizza however, as long as I don't eat it too fast.

I can't work due to my health and the amount of school that I'm taking right now, and so have been living off of what loans I can get it- it was working pretty well, but then my health took a nosedive and it cut into what I had budgeted for groceries.

I should be getting a refund check in a few days, but until then I don't have anything. Once I'm back on my feet, I plan to pay this forward, I promise.

I live in Valdosta, Georgia, and you have no idea how grateful I would be if someone was able to give me a pizza, honestly!

Please and Thank you, to the generous soul reading this! - Lex

Pizza for a Birthday Party of One, redux: the Double Pizza-ning
Hey again-- I posted here about a year ago but I'm back again; this time, WITH COUPONS! 

I'm spending my birthday alone in the dorms this year (my best friend is home visiting his parents), and with very little money to spare, I was hoping someone could help me celebrate my birthday with a greasy pizza pie! 

I've got a lot of Papa John's coupons, and they deliver to my school. And, the best part is, if the order comes to at least $15, I'll have enough rewards points to gift someone else a Papa John's pizza this weekend!

A birthday present and the promise to pay it forward on this sub, all in one.

Haven't had my favorite food in 4 months, would really love a pie or even just a slice.
In college, I ate pizza at the school cafeteria at least once a day, every day, for four years. Since I graduated almost a year ago, I haven't been able to afford pizza (a story in itself). The last time I had a pizza was when my girlfriend got me one for Christmas. I've been craving pizza for quite a while now and I would love it if someone could help me out.

I'm not really sure how this works or if I qualify, but I really love pizza.

End of Month and I have only noodles with butter or a random act of pizza, hopefully
Only thing is I live in Germany, so most of you guys cant offer me a pizza i guess :/

edit: Not sure if I should tell a bit why I cant afford a pizza for myself and post a request here... is that too beggary? Is it really necessary? I just say for the moment I'm a student and this month was financially rough caused by some unexpected bills. I have a job since yesterday, but first salary will be paid end of april, not now.

I am currently locked out of my flat with no food or relief in sight
So after leaving work at 3pm, walking the 4km home I realised I had no keys. My girlfriend is not answering her phone (she is in basement workshop at uni).

I've been here for 2 hours so far, thankfully I have a tablet, and the WiFi is working through my door. Weather is pish. 




I'm in Aberdeen, Scotland
Edit 1: Me right now http://imgur.com/fy7jj7T at least I'm in a hall right! Edit 2: The girl across the hall just got Chinese takeaway delivered, she looked at my sad eyes and walked back inside - no Christmas card for that flat! Edit 3: Well that's the three hour mark come and gone.

Broke, unemployed recent grad fighting depression -- Trying again!
Hey.  I got pizza'd a couple years ago and I submitted a request a few weeks ago.  Someone responded, but there wasn't a Papa John's around me so he couldn't help.  Figured I'd try again.

I'm a recent university grad.  After graduation I found a job immediately and lived with my girlfriend in our own apartment.  I lost all of that in January, for various reasons out of my control, and I spent two months this year recovering from mono, making it impossible for me to find a new job.  Apparently I was living with mono for nearly two years and it was a relief to recover, but I lost everything I had and had to start again from scratch.  I've been back on the job search for the last month and I've been getting tons of interview opportunities, but now I'm broke and hungry.  I've been keeping occupied with various community projects and resume builders, but nothing's been paying yet.  I keep telling myself maybe this is the day I'll find a job.  Maybe tomorrow.  

It's been a tough year and I'm trying to rise above it.  A little nutrition and kindness from a stranger would be a nice pick up.

It's not all gloomy.  I found myself a great living situation with some very cool people.  And I've got a few prospects on the horizon.  I'm just hungry :P

Thanks for reading my sob story anyway.  It helps just writing it all out.  This is an awesome community and I hope to contribute in the future.

Edit:  I forgot to mention, but I am literally out of food right now. Otherwise I wouldn't be doing this. I just have no idea how else to feed myself tonight. Thanks. Cheers!

broke and moving.
I'm in the process of moving today and after a whole day of moving I notice I have no food in the house. Check my bank account and it is way in the red... I have another week until payday.

I really wanted to feed the wonderful people who helped me, if anyone wants to help me out I can. Will pay it forward when I break even.

Let go from my job
Hello everyone,

This is difficult to explain mostly because I'm bad with words, but the gist of it is I was let go from the vet hospital I worked for today. I've been working there only for two weeks, and the doctor called me into his office to tell me that he had to let me go for now. One of my co-workers was leaving for maternity leave, and they needed a full-timer (not a part-timer like me) to fill the gap while she's gone. I don't really know what happened to the other part time girl, but I assume it's the same situation for her. The doc told me he might call me in six to eight months, but I've heard that before and I doubt it.

I finished my last shift and came back to my dorm room and I just collapsed on my bed for six hours. No more puppies, no more fun times for me. It's spring break for now and I'm having a hard time finding the energy to walk to get some food this late in Los Angeles. 

Would appreciate some pick-me-up pizzas, though I doubt anyone will reach me this late. Thanks for reading.

MO] I have rent, but not much else.
SO. I got my last paycheck from my other job (while I wait to start my new one), and it's JUST enough to cover my next month's rent (got 310, rent is 295). You see my dilemma. So I'm asking for a little help through the slump. I'm more than willing to pay you back on my next payday, which I think is in three weeks. I start monday, so it'll either be next week or three weeks from then. 

Thanks for reading!

Home grown cat rescue needs some human food
My wife and I have been taking care of the numerous stray cats around our apartment, including the mamas and kittens. We have car food for weeks but our human supplies are dwindling. A pizza would set our mind at ease and give me the strength to carry the mama cat to the vet. 
I can show you pictures of cats in exchange. If you want more details on the rescue send me a PM

Couple of broke peeps bored at home.
We're pretty low on funds right now and payday isn't for a week.  We are just a young-ish married couple figuring out what to do for dinner.  A large pizza is all we require, pizza hut, papa johns, dominos are all good with us. We will pay it forward when we become more liquid next week.  

Thanks!

Please if someone is able, could you feed me? :(
I've been both a giver and a receiver in this sub, but right now I'm looking for help. I've been off work due to a broken leg and I ran out of Sick Pay. My claim for support has taken over 6 weeks already and I've just been told I need to re-send all my medical documents over. Because of this admin error, I've had no food other than bread and rice in about 3 weeks. I've had the odd random thing like some ham etc, but I was kind of hoping someone in a better situation than me would be kind enough to help me out. I'm happy to provide copies of medical documents to prove I am off work if need or anything else. I promise I will return the favor once I am able too. Thanks so much. I am from the UK and the best franchise is probably Dominos.

No money until my paycheck comes in tomorrow. My family would love a pizza and I have a pay it forward proposal.
Hi.  Because of my paycycle it has been over two weeks since my last paycheck and I have been out of money for 4 days now (spent my last $15 on diapers).  I am expecting my regular paycheck as well as my bonus paycheck at midnight tomorrow night so I will have the means to pay it forward 5-fold.  I will offer one pizza a day for 5 days next week if I receive pizza today.  I have Papa Ginos, Dominos and a variety of local pizza joints near me.   I am hoping to receive and give pizza in the next week so I can have some nifty flair.  Thanks and have a great weekend!

Pizza in my mouth hole, and a short story will come out.
**Tl;DR**

**Strict budget, not starving, pizza sounds nice, short story in return.**


I haven't had a decent pizza in months.  We have been on a strict budget trying to save up enough to get my girlfriend a car so I can quit spending all my free time driving everyone in the house around.  A pizza that didn't come out of my freezer would be fantastic!

**With That Said**

I am by **NO** means starving.  Please take care of anyone else that needs it more than I.  For me it will just be a tasty treat to enjoy on my day off.  I just don't want to take food away from someone who could use it more than I could.  

However.  If you do decide to send me some deliciousness, in return I would write you a short story.  [A Sample of my Writing](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2vzqnr/wp_you_wake_up_in_an_empty_hospital_with_an/comcc1f) to help you decide.  

I fair best with Sci-Fi but I am sure I could churn out anything you might fancy.  Even if that is a trashy romance story.  (**Please don't make me write a trashy romance story!**)

Papa Johns is right down the road and my favorite.  I also have a Domino's.  Pizza will feed me.  I am sure my girlfriend will eat some when she gets off work.  I am in Bettendorf, Iowa.

Actually they don't really care, but we're poor and I'm still sore and bleeding. I'm in Iowa so the only pizza places we have are Pizza Hut and Casey's, but hey, it's still good pizza! Would be much appreciated.

My rocket crash landed and now I'm stuck in the middle of a desert. Oh, and my evil brother is after me...
I have no idea what this "reddit" is, but I thought I would ask for help since I maxed my credits and I don't think this planet takes credits. I'll start from the beginning. So, back on my home planet, I got a job from my master to take a rocket to Belshi. But unfortunatly my evil brother has to take everything I have. Unfortunatley he shot my pod down and drained it of its power. Lucky for me, I had a backup. So I started zooming away from him and on a speeding chase. Then I found this planet that I could crash on. Now I'm stuck, disguised as the dominant species on this desolate planet, hungry, and alone. Trying to hide away from my brother who will eventually find me. I just hope it's not too late to eat something... 


EDIT: Apparently I'm right across the street from a "papa john's" in a little town

Paid off my debts, but need to head to the community food pantry tomorrow. A pizza or two would help.
Just what it says on the tin. Finally got my credit card under control, my well past due utility bills that were in collections, and other such things. It sucked seeing all of my tax return slip away like that while i'm out of work, but it's also a bit of a load off my mind not to have those things hanging over my head. 

I have pizza hut, papa johns, and dominos locally. I promise to pay it forward with my first paycheck, whenever i pick up a job or 2 here.

Injured, car trouble, hoping things get better
Currently dealing with a possible cracked rib from soccer, have a power steering fluid leak in my car, and I found out today somebody STOLE my side mirror. Yeah, the mirror itself is missing, not the whole thing, just the glass. Come on! Ok, things could definitely be worse. I'm alive and young and can feed myself, but I figured pizza is always a good way to get in a good mood! I've got the big 3 in my area (always a fan of dominos) and would rather not drive as it physically hurts to have to turn without power steering and a messed up rip cage. I am in the verification system, and I'm always down to pay it forward! Thanks for reading!

Musician living in Nashville, will play you a tune in exchange for pizza.
Hi there, fellow humans. I'm barely scraping by these days, and would love to eat today. I usually do alright, but things have been pretty slow this year, so I'm reaching out to you kind-hearted and hopefully not tomato-throwing redditors. Actually, I'll take tomatoes if you're willing to throw them. Just not rotten ones, please.

I'll make a youtube video of a song for you in exchange for pizza. Original or a cover, you can pick! Folk/indie is my genre.

I'll draw you something awesome of your choosing if you'll help out and give a broke girl a pizza. All I've got is a six pack of ramen for the next four days, and a drag queen owes me 50 that I'm never going to see again. Please, bros. Help help.

Please help, College kid in pain
...Hunger pangs I mean. I just paid my rent and the $10 left over was used for gas. Pizza isn't much but it's better than the constant stream of canned food and might distract me from my quarter life crisis long enough for me to accomplish something. I sincerely appreciate any goodwill! North DFW area.

Active duty Marine in trouble after being snitched on for a fake id and now i'm broke
So long story short I have had a fake id for about a year now. I'm 20yrs old and I drink far less than most underage Marines. But a friend saw I had one and asked if I could get him one. I thought i'd be a bro and hook him up, so I told him to come by later. He comes over and I show him mine, as soon as he has it in his hands he opens the door revealing my superiors standing there. So now i'm being demoted and my pay is cut in half for 3 more weeks so i'm broke. My story isn't one riddled with cancer and dying dogs but I could use some pizza which I will gladly pass on when my pay is restored to normal. Thanks for hearing out my sob story.

Greenwood, Nova Scotia Canada - No food in the fridge. Payday tomorrow. Would love some pizza.
Hey guys. I'll try to keep this short. My wife and I split up in January and since then I've been pretty well putting every spare dollar I have to making sure she's adequately set up in her new life. Unfortunately this payday I seem to have dropped the ball and ran out of food in my fridge yesterday. I don't get paid until tomorrow and quite frankly tomorrow's pay is not going to be fun either. If possible I could really use some pizza to fill my hungry belly and put me in a good mood for bill day tomorrow. It also might help me feel a bit better about my upcoming divorce. We're still pretty freshly separated and to say it hurts is the understatement of the year. (We've been together since 2005) Thanks to anyone who can help. PS - I'm in a small town so the pizza options are limited to Greco's pizza, Pizza Delight and a terrific family owned place down the road called Mimie's Pizza.

Pizza for a student in Australia?
This is my first time to come across a sub like this, and after a few minutes going of scrolling and reading some posts, it really seems like an amazing community that has been put together here. 


Anyways, I'm 18 and living in Perth, Australia and i'm attending university doing a Bachelor of Science Degree and working part-time at a grocery store. This is my first year living out of home, and i'm in the typical broke-student scenario. Basically all of the money i earn throughout the week whilst working goes towards my rent and utilities. I'm quite hungry and it's been a long few days and i'd really love a pizza to compliment an evening of study, and i'd be sure to pay it forward come this Friday when i get paid. Thank you for your time! :D

Bed ridden and broke student in north Florida. Please help me through a miserable day.
My next disbursement doesn't come until Friday, and my next paycheck isn't until tomorrow.  However, I came down with a really rough sickness last night, and am still quite ill today.  I have no food in my apartment, and I'm riding on 36 cents in my account.  I would love to have a hot meal to get me through today, and upon my word as an Eagle Scout, this act of kindness would be paid forward on this thread.

Lunch with Grandma
Class got cancelled today and I'm home with my grandma all day, and I kinda wanted to have lunch with her and just talk. We both really love pizza, so if anyone could help out, that would be quite fantastic. I get paid this Thursday too, so i'll pay it forward for sure

Edit: Still haven't received a pizza :p Would still like one though

USA SACRAMENTO:: My neighbor had to go to the emergency room and I've agreed to watch his kids. I now have my twin girls and his 3 boys and some pizza would really help me out!!
My good friend / neighbor cut his hand pretty bad installing a new green house and is off for some stitches. We are always having each others kids back and forth at our houses so its not that big of a deal but honestly were a week from payday and money / food is tight. I just don't have enough to feed 3 boys 2+ meals today. 

It has to be either Pizza Hut or Little Caesars and they don't deliver to us because of the bad neighborhood so it'd have to be for pick up. 

Thank you so much ahead of time.

I'd like a pizza tonight. 


I'd prefer Round Table but if that is too pricey, Pizza Hut or Dominos will do. 

Also, Tuesday is tomorrow (Mar. 31st) so you can have either PayPal or a pizza tomorrow.

my job and I'm depressed
Well as the title says...I lost my job. No fault of my own, but the choice was voluntary redundancy (which I took) or hand in notice. I get a weeks pay but that's needed to cover the bills. I am also suffering with depression, and I take citalopram 40mg as a result, which was bought on by the work and home environment.

As a result it's been a crap day and could do with cheering up.

Pizza for Poetry - OK
Pizza details: I'm in Norman, OK. I have two mouths to feed. We have a Papa John's, a Dominos, and a Pizza Hut in range. (Plus a number of smaller places if you are a local)

Poetry details: Upon delivery, I will send you a poem written by me, 100% original, and never published anywhere. In fact, I will be writing during the delivery time so if there are specific things you need from your poem, let me know in the exchange that will take place and I will try to accommodate. With your permission I will make it part of a Thank You post, however that isn't necessary.

Could use a pizza to get me through the next three days
Would someone be able to send me a pizza from a chain in the USA, in Ohio? My account is overdrafted until thursday. While that bill piles up, I could really use a pizza or something to get me through the next day at least. It's 9pm here and there is nothing available for emergency situations. Can someone help a hungry dude out? I'll pay it forward on Thursday!

boyfriend ever deserves a pizza.
I have the sweetest boyfriend on the planet. He is the most generous person I have ever met.. with both friends and strangers. He is going through a lot right now due to epileptic seizures and stress. I have just started a new job, but the pay doesn't start for a couple of weeks. We are down to a half bag of tortilla chips and some peanut butter! Could you help with a pizza to help me cheer him up? All we want to do is cuddle on the sofa with a pizza and a movie, but I can't provide that for us right now. He tries so hard to stay positive, but I can tell he's feeling blue today. It would mean so much to me to make him smile. Please help. We will pay it forward next month when we have pizza money to share. Thank you!

Poor college kid would love some pizza.
Just going to be honest. I'm poor. I've been eating dining hall food for the last week and I just want some real food. All the money I have right is now in a savings account that will go towards my dues at the end of the semester. Would really appreciate any act of pizza :)

A single pizza for the (starving) family would be great.
Hi - a little detailing, I guess. Me, my father, mother, uncle, aunt, and little sister (aged fourteen) have to deal with a week out of every month where we basically are scrimping the very bottom of the barrel for food - appropriately dubbed "poor week". My mother and father are disabled while my uncle and I work, but between rent and such we're usually always broke towards the end no matter what. At the time of writing It's tuesday, and we get paid Thursday to finally end this. More than anything I'm worried for my father, who, after a Lap-Band surgery (otherwise known as an Adjustable Gastric Band) can't keep a lot of things down without retching it up within the next hour, meaning he's most starved out of all of us. Right now we've been surviving solely off of ramen and grits, our reserves whittled down to very little; even a single pie to split up between the six of us would make the strain just a bit less unbearable. Any help provided would be immensely appreciated. If I'm leaving anything out here, please, PLEASE don't hesitate to PM me. I'm trying to be as upfront as possible.

Roomie eaten by evil graveyard tunnels, demons chasing me, job lost along with almost a week of missing time, cupboard empty, morale low. Could use a slice of delicious, cheesy moral support.
Hi, guys, my name is Holly, and earlier this month me and my best friend Jude went to explore some underground tunnels underneath the oldest graveyard in town. I didn't believe all the ghost stories about them. Not then. When I woke up missing five days and Jude, I was forced to reconsider. She's been missing for about three weeks now. She might be dead, she might be kidnapped, or her spirit might be trapped on some other plane. The tunnels are mysteriously sealed off now, and I'm being stalked by giant evil shadow creatures while I try to solve the mystery and find my friend. I lost my job because of the missing time, my savings account is dangerously low, and my pantry runneth dry. I'm down to Ramen and the ancient, dusty cans of vegetables from the back of the cabinet that nobody ever eats if they can help it. So I could really use a favor. I'm in Decatur, IL, where we have either Dominos or Pizza Hut. A fresh, piping hot pizza and some cold fizzy soda would do my weary soul a world of good right now. You can check out my post history if you want to read the details of my ongoing battle with the forces of evil. I humbly ask the pizza gods for their blessing on my quest.

In a rut and need to buy hay and new brakes. Would love a hot meal right now (CO)
I have 2 1/2 horses (one is a mini...bad joke) that are almost out of hay, and my truck is not (safely) usable right now due to brake issues. I had to leave my job, home, and move my horses in January due to an abusive situation, and have been playing catch-up since. I lived and worked where my horses were kept, so it was a huge upset in my life. I'm starting up a new job now and things are getting better, but in the mean time I'm barely squeaking by in order to pay for bills, car repairs and to keep my animals happy and well-fed. Would love a little pick-me-up, and would definitely love to return the favor later on when I'm back on my feet! Happy to verify myself as well, just ask for my code!

san antonio- Car and Wallet stolen, checking acct sent into overdraft, havent eaten since yesterday, wont have finances till Fri, uncomfortable asking for help
Last night I made some stupid choices. I let what amounts to a stranger into my home. i had naked fun time With them. a hookup. I dont get that kind of attention as often these days and let my guard down. I left them alone and unattended. then drugs appear.  Six months sobriety gone. I take a shower. I come out. My tablet is gone. my wwallet is gone. My keys are gone.  I run outside and my car is gone. I dont have a lot of stuff. Im rebuilding already. My car was the last great thing I had from when things were good. but whats gone most is my sense of self. I let it happen. bank account is overdrafted in minutes, gas card us used. They're staying with the car. My family is estranged.  I am not one to ask for things. But if someone out there wants to send me one or two 1toppings, god willing a two liter... I would be endebted, endeared,  and very grateful.

Would really Like some Pizza
I live in the chicagoland area as a student.  I have been working hard to pay for school and living expenses.  I usually get by but can never really afford any takeout food as my food budget is usually really small.  I manage to not go hungry by eating a lot of rice with veggies but this bland food gets old kinda fast.  I really am just hoping someone would be kind enough to treat me to something that tastes better than rice.

I'm not in any bad position, I just have been doing school work and cleaning my room and my aunt's house (where I live) all day. I'm exhausted, but I still have more homework and studying ahead, and a pizza would sound great right now.

Hey guys and gals! My name is Rodney! I know it is probably odd to ask, but, Im in between pay periods with my new job and was just curious if there might be anyone that could buy me some pizza from the local gas station here in Gettysburg, SD... its called Gas and Goodies. If you could, I would appreciate it very much!

Also, I am doing some wood carvings and would love some ideas if anyone has some, even if there is no Pizza involved. lol!

Thanks in advance, even if you just say hi or something. Have a great day, and happy Pizza-ing... lol!

A couple pizzas for my (visiting) brothers and I.
Title says it all, my two brothers are visiting from Maine and I wanted to get some pizza to celebrate the occasion! We typically don't get to see each other very often anymore so as you can imagine, I'm pretty excited! I don't really think where the pizza comes from matters, but we typically used to get papa john's back when we were kids. I live in Indiana so they're probably going to be hungry from the ride. This place has been good to me before so hopefully it'll work it's magic again. If anyone can help me out before they get here tomorrow, I'd definitely appreciate it. Thanks!

[US] Ive eaten my neighbors table scraps for the last two days and my family won't let me come to easter. I might not eat again until Monday.
My neighbor has been giving me his table scraps for the last two days but his wife told him to stop, and NY fridge is empty. I dropped out of college and my family refused to let me come to Easter. My rents due Wednesday and I won't get paid till Monday. I'm so sorry to ask but could someone send me a pizza? I got no friends to ask and I'm just awful at asking for things because I hate to be a burden. When I get paid I will definitely buy you a pizza, no joke. It just doesn't look like I'm eating until Monday and I'm worried. Any help would be appreciated!

Just found a new job, but won't start until the 20th. A pizza would be nice.
I lost my job back in January. Finally managed to find a new one. I have had a pretty shitty past few months however. My Internet was shut off (I'm on mobile), power was cut off about 2 months ago (been running cords from an empty place of business right next to my house)  and my motorcycle was stolen. Can you please just get me a greasy, unhealthy pizza? I'll pay it forward may 4th when I get paid.

Pizza for a good cause!
Hello! My brother needs pizzas for an anime convention at Old Dominion University in Norfolk Va on the 4th of April. The entire goal of the thing is to raise money for Relay for Life and they need pizza to feed their staff. They are tight on money, so any pizza would help.   I know they'd really appreciate it. At the moment, they don't have the ability to feed to staff past shitty little snacks. Which is lame. 

I think they deserve a pizza or two. Anyone out there want to help out?

Pizza Just Because.
I have no sob story, I'm just kinda hungry and can't be bothered to look for food in my cupboards. If anyone wants to be awesome and give me a pizza, I'll pay it forward at some point.

Just got a new job, now have a week without work, would love some pizza to last a few days
Started a job at a school about a week ago, and yesterday was the start of spring break, so won't be back to work until the 13th.

A large pizza would be easy 3-days of food, since I'm the only one in the house right now.

I'm in mid-Michigan, near Flint

Tired, hungry, and recovering from surgery
Hi RAOP, I had my gallbladder removed Thursday evening. I stayed with a friend that night and last while getting through the worst of the pain. I'm back home now, but I'm not supposed to bend over or lift anything for a few weeks. My roommates are gone hiking, and between the lifting-ban and the almost narcolepsy from the pain meds, I really cannot conceive of being able to cook anything today. I don't have any money right now or else I wouldn't be throwing myself at the mercy of others. I'm in Austin, TX. My friend still has my car because I don't think it is safe for me (or anyone else, for that matter!) for me to drive while on pain medication. I would sincerely appreciate any assistance that could be granted. If nobody is able to help, I understand that too. just to note: I've previously received a pizza from here over two years ago, way way back when this subreddit first started. Proof: [Discharge paperwork with username](http://imgur.com/N58GewW) [Picture of my gallbladder once removed that they sent home with me-- holy crap there were a lot of stones in there!! ](http://imgur.com/HSK8dGy) [Bank Account](http://imgur.com/IdfqcUK)

Still down on my luck
forgetful for whomever pizza'd me before and offered further advice, but me and my dad are still in quite the strut to be honest and its depressing. I had a part time job recently that ended up falling through because the business didn't make it. So we are back living on his unemployment between the two of us and me trying to do odd jobs to keep us above water. Back to applying places but northeast ohio is quite a struggle. Willing to pay it forward or pay it back when im on my feet or some other way.

Husband and I took our dog to the vet after being sick and now we have no money.
My dog Marley was very sick over the week and we decided once my husband got paid that we would take her to the vet to ensure she was going to be okay. Now we are out over $300 which was any money that we had to eat.

We have no family around for Easter which means we won't be having an Easter family or an Easter dinner.

All alone and broke on Easter. Pizza would keep it from being completely miserable.
I have nowhere to go and I don't have any money to go out myself. It's looking pretty bleak. A pizza would really brighten up my Easter. Otherwise my Easter meal is going to consist of one package of uncooked poptarts (everytime I try to toast them they get stuck between the toaster and the lift And are can not be unstuck with out smashing into crumbs). Well anyway, Happy Easter Everybody.

Willing to exchange personalized song/poem/story for Papa Johns on this fine Easter Sunday :)
I'm Jewish actually so after the second seder last night I'm really craving some bread product today. I'll write you a  song or a poem or a story of whatever theme you'd like in exchange for some 'za. Down to negotiate alternate exchanges too if you wanted something else. Personally love me some papa john's but beggars can't be choosers, eh? I'm in Northern Virginia if it matters &lt;3

Another lonely student with an Easter request
Hey RAOP,

Happy Pagan Fertility Celebration :) I was ditched today by the guy I'm sort of dating and everybody else is busy or just not feeling like hanging out.. I think I could at least tempt some of them with the offer of Pizza and Mad Men, and while I've got Mad Men and drinks, I'm lacking on the pizza part. I've given and received before and I'd just appreciate some great pie today. 

Thanks :)

My dog didn't die, my grandma is fine, and I don't have a cancer. I'm just a bigger brother who wants a little help paying for pizza for my little sister's birthday, so my mom can get a break.
I don't have a sob story and don't want anyone to feel bad for me, I don't even want free pizza, I'm just looking for help paying for it.   
   
Okay, so long story short, my little sister is having her birthday and every year my parents do everything for her, especially my amazing mom. She did it with me when I was younger and does it for my brothers as well. Since we dont have a lot of money, she always went out and bought ingredients and slaved over during the day making the pizzas herself. I told her for my sister's birthday she can take a break.   
   
So, living in Canada, pizza is more expensive than the USA (you guys are so lucky!). I did the math and went the cheapest route and will be buying it from Pizza Pizza (cheapest pizza in Canada) and for all the kids, including the drinks and everything, is going to cost me around a little over $55 with tax and delivery and tip.    
    
I dont want anyone to pay for the whole thing and if you offer i will refuse. I just would like help paying for it. I spent the last 45min searching for good coupons, like a "15% off the whole order" but couldn't find any like that, only bland deals.
   
Well, there's my story. I know it's not your typical request but thought I'd try. It's a lot of money for me and I will be buyiing it no matter what, I will bite the bullet, I just thought I'd ask for help.

two homeless in Ft Worth, rainy and dead streets, spare a pizza?
Just two homeless guys thinking of food options tonight. Rainy easter means not many people out right now, wet dumpsters and few places even open. We have a pack of rice and some raven, but gathering the cooking supplies, and then getting a fire going, takes a few hours (assuming it doesn't rain much harder). 

Could anyone kick a pizza down? Can take a picture if I need to, this is my raop cherry popping post. Thanks.

Temporary layoff, but my unemployment checks don't come in for three weeks, when the layoff will be nearly over anyway.
So, I work a factory job that is seasonal, and during spring and summer we lose a lot of business. So we have layoffs of course. I am laid off as of last monday, with my first day back being April 27th. 

I was told I would be compensated, and to just go to the unemployment office for my checks. I did that, and there is a 1 week waiting period, followed by the bi-weekly payment structure. So I have to "work" two weeks to apply for that check. As it stands, I get my first check on the 20th if April, one week before I go back. 

Right now, I have $1.68 in my Checking Account. $12 in my savings. Today my car payment is due. On the 10th my car insurance is due. The 13th water, the 14th electricity. My car payment is weekly as well, so I will actually miss 3 payments before I get my first unemployment check.

I went to the food stamp office today, and was denied SNAP benefits since they had to use my most recent paystub, I make too much.

So while I'm sick with stress of what I am going to do over the next 3 or 4 weeks, I'd really just like to get fat and play video games while I have electricity. 

Once I get back to work, I will get my unemployment checks and my normal paychecks, so I will be back on track. After that I will be happy to give back to this community. 

I live in the US. I love all chains of pizza, haha.
It's just me and my girlfriend who live here, she gets paid on the 1st and 15th of the month, and we already used her check from the 1st for rent, internet, phones, and her car insurance.

Thank you so much for even considering. &lt;3

A Random Tale for Random Pizza
So, here is my tale of woe, and by that, I mean how I got here.

Ohio Born, probably gonna be here till I die, as is the way of Ohio.

Tried to order a pizza off of Papa Johns, realized I didn't have enough for any type of pizza. Damn bills.

Decided to hunt down the Papa Johns subreddit, to see what they where up too. To my surprise, the answer is nothing.

Then I tried to order from Larosas. But they ended up being even more expensive than Papa Johns. So I went to check their subreddit, but it doesn't exist. So, I go to the Subreddit search, and look for pizza. Maybe pictures of food will make me less hungry.

So, in my infinite search for pizza, I come across this subreddit. And it looks pretty cool, what y'all do. So I figured I'd throw my hat in the ring to see if I could get a pizza. I don't need it or anything, I'm just kinda hungry, and this is Random acts of pizza, so I figure my chances are as good as anyones.

For added points: [Here's a subreddit of sharks being Tsundere](http://www.reddit.com/r/TsundereSharks/)

Pizza for a recently unemployed furmom.
I lost my job a little over a month ago and I've stretched my severance pay as much as I can. Pizza isn't the healthiest or best for my digestive problems but its cheap and feeds me for a couple meals since I live alone with my adorable furbaby. I work freelance so any help I get will be met with an offer to do something for you. Be it a logo, or a photo edit, or a facebook cover photo, etc. I work freelance design and photography and just need something to tide me over for a few days while I wait on my clients to pay their invoices (and most of that money is going to my medications, dog food, and car payment plus groceries for myself and other bills as much as I can.)

My mom is terminally ill so I've had to crash at my boyfriend's house to avoid risking my mom's immune system.

Hi! I'm pulling an all nighter tonight for a bitch of a clinical exam tomorrow, and having pizza tonight will totally motivate me not to kill anyone tomorrow during my exam. :) Kidding, but I am too broke to buy food until this Friday (thank god for payday), and food will actually be wonderful for my otherwise awful all-nighter.

Just looking to satisfy my pizza urges tonight.
Hi all,

Recently un-engaged (if that's a word?) so a bit down on my spirits but trying not to make that what dictates my mood.

Decided to hang out in downtown with a Co worker tonight (staying at her apartment) and figured I'd try my luck at a random pizza. 

I'm in Michigan and looking on Google I see there's a Jets that delivers around here. 

Really appreciate y'all taking the time out of your day :)

Have a good Tuesday!

Normal day (OKC OK area)
Hello, Today's been a pretty normal day: made it work on time at 10:00am, had an office meeting, ate a [lunch](http://i.imgur.com/dof0hP1.jpg) I made last night, enrolled people for continuing education classes, and finally went home 7:30pm. However, as I was driving home I passed by the 3 different pizza delivery cars (Dominos, Papa Johns, and Pizza Hut) and now I have the urge to eat pizza. The only problem is that I’m basically broke. I have $3.42 in my account, but since I only have 50 miles of gas in my car, the little money I have is going to gas tomorrow morning. I get paid this Friday, so I’m more than happy to return the favor or passing along the kindness. What that ~~said~~ typed, I thought I’d try my luck at a random pizza. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

In NC, exhausted, and hungry. Requesting a 'za!
Hey all! 

I'll be totally honest. I am broke as hell until this coming Friday (my birthday AND payday! DOUBLE YAY) but am completely willing to pay it forward when Friday rolls around! 

I am exhausted, spent all day at work, came home and scrubbed my apartment (I'm going out of town for my birthday weekend and don't want to have to deal with it at the last minute), and didn't get out of the shower and settle down until an hour ago.

In short, I am way too tired to bother making dinner, I am STARVING and would REALLY appreciate a pizza.

Like I said, I'll happily pay it forward when Friday rolls around! Pizza pizza!

It's my cheat day on my new diet so I was going to have myself a litle pizza here at the office. It's actually completely inedible. The two bites I've taken were hastily spit out, hoping that maybe it was just the outer crust that tasted of Satan's salty butthole.

I'm not going to die of starvation or anything like that, but I had my heart set on pizza and this abomination I have before me is more serviceable as a frisbee. As a matter of fact, if you send me a pizza, I will take a video of me using this cardboard creation AS a frisbee and send it to you. How cool is that?

Just moved into our new house. Would love some pizza to celebrate!!
Just moved into our new house and we would LOVE to have our favorite food to celebrate! We have a Domino's, Little Ceasers and Pizza Hut in town. Also, I've been craving pizza for solid week! The frozen junk just doesn't compare.

just quit my job. Not smart to spend money but I feel free and want to celebrate.
Moving to a cheaper city to figure out what's next. Trying to sell most of my apt items and won't have a fridge soon/hopefully. I got my first new job app denial yesterday but looking forward to doing some consulting and possibly building my own company.

For the sake of curiosity, let's see if there's someone from Iceland on this sub, willing to send some slice my way. Done this once before without luck, let's try again.
I live in Iceland, so random acts of pizza are rare to find, both as a giver and receiver. Let's see if this works out.

WI,USA - Recently had some very expensive car repairs done (still in the shop) and my girlfriend and I could really use a pizza.
I recently had to spend $730 on my car for repairs, and then had to do another $1,700 worth of repairs... Basically, pizza would really help me and my girlfriend out.

Chicago, IL - broke student fucked over by ex
where to begin... 
so I had these neighbors, we'll call them x and y. they met me the night I tried to kill myself. we have been best friends since. x and y's roommates all moved out after first semester, so they received new roommates. this is where z (my now-ex) comes into the picture. 

The first date we go on is to the school formal. later that night, we become romantically involved. we were what I considered 'together'. Two months pass and I am diagnosed with manic bipolar &amp; unspecified disorder. no big deal. I made her aware of my situation. all was going well. until I noticed that she was becoming more and more vague. I notice instances where she is manipulative and passive-aggressive. I start spending more time worrying than I spend hanging out with her. I should note she also did not want me telling x and y anything about our relationship, so far as to say "don't talk about me, or I'll never talk to you again." I get sick of being undervalued and decide to break it off with her after my friend confronts her and she denies both being together and being romantically involved.

at this point, x and y are confused as to who's telling the truth. I showed x and y the scars z's left on me from our romantic involvement. I let them read all my texts, starting from the beginning. 

x tells me that my story is almost identical to that of another of her friends, whom apparently z was leading on as well throughout the course of our involvement. 

x doesn't believe me now, and believes I'm stalking z.

tl;dr - ex girlfriend turns my good friends on me, haven't slept in two days, broke and out of food. could go for a pizza. 

if you've made it this far, congrats.

Kicked out of my house after a relatives funeral. (Noblesville, IN)
It's been a long day guys. Kicked out of my house after my uncles funeral for "not having family loyalty." So I'm sitting here on a buddy's floor and could go for a slice of joy as a pick-me-up. It'd be greatly appreciated on such a sob story of a day. thanks fellas.

Hearken, ye givers of pizza, to mine tales of woe and despair, lest ye be ridden with guilte
Trulee, I am the most deserv'd of pizza amongst all the poor louts of this subreddit, if ye will only hear mine pleas. For many dayes and nights I have longed for pizza, the most delicious of all the foodstuffs, yet mine desires remain unfulfilled. The ache of my belly hast only been surpass'd by the pain of my heart, as I ponder the circumstances whereagainst mine deprivation flows.

Pizza is more than a lost love cleft in twain; it is the very purpose and meaning of life. Alack! I toile long dayes, but wherein may I find satisfaction without the most divinely favored meal a man can manage? Erelong, I shall scarcely have the energy to lift a finger or tumble out of bed. Without hope, what manne may find the strength to struggle against life's challenges?

Many times I have contemplated the sweet embrace of death, for a life without pizza is not a life at all, but merely a lesser shade of death, a purgatory before God's most righteous judgment. Yet, with mine sins having been washed clean from the lack of pizza I have thusly endured, why must I continue to suffer, whenas I would have surely ascended to Heaven by now were this the afterlife? Wherewith my relief be delivered?

Truthfully, I have had my lapses of faith, for it does not seem God could be both so just and so cruel, but I believe now. Surely God will deliver upon me some angel, some divine savior, some man or woman carved from the very image of charity and goodness! Surely I cannot be made to suffer for an eternity!

could someone feed me
Dear Reddit,

I highly doubt this is going to work but desperate times calls for desperate measures! Currently me and a friend are stuck at home hungry with no money. We are both pizza lovers and have spent the last 2 hours talking about how nice a pizza would be. If possible could someone take pity on our poor souls? We have all been hungry at one point or another and I hope you can empathise with our current situation. As I thank you I will take a picture of me eating said pizza!

Living in a ghetto motel. No kitchen. No food anyhow.
So. I have had a rough week. Well, rough few weeks. I was living with a boyfriend who dumped me abruptly to go be with his ex leaving me homeless. A friend took me in but ended up getting hooked on heroin, so I got out of there and had a roommate that seemed awesome. No,  she was legit psycho and I ended up getting out of there to live with 2 friends, their 3rd roommate told me it was cool all the time knowing she was going to kick them (and me) out in a few days because she found someone on craigslist. 

So...we are all in a really crummy motel. All the nice ones were booked until next week. It is like prostitutes and crack heads. we are also paying a ton to be here. So, regardless of having gotten a really decent job a few weeks ago all my money goes to rent and then saving to get into a 4 bedroom house. 

Also there is no kitchen here. Not that I have food to cook. ._. 

Oh, little bit of an added jab from the universe...the key card has papa johns pizza on it. 


(I am vegan so was hoping to get a papa johns pizza as they can make a really loaded pizza with veggies.)

UK uni student stressed, revising for exams and keeping an eye on a flatmate who passed out last night.
I'm a student at manchester university in the UK, exam revision is in full swing, just 4 weeks to go! I wasn't able to go shopping last night because my flatmate passed out and I had to look after her, the paramedics from the ambulance said not to leave her alone too much in the next day or so and just keep an eye on her. So I'm sitting here in my flat, with this girl I don't actually like all that much revising for my Advanced dynamics final, and to be totally honest, craving a pizza XD can anyone help me out? My nearest chain is a Dominoes. I don't have all that much to offer in return (being a poor student and all) but I'd be happy to try and explain any simple physics/maths questions you might have (dunno why you'd have any, but hey maybe you have a kid who's stuck on his homework or something).

Hi. If you guys didn't know, the first four episodes of the new GOT season were leaked. I am paying the Iron price for them right now as they download, I'd absolutely love if someone could foot the bill for a Pepperoni pizza? I'd love to return the favor to a member of this sub come Friday - because a Redditor  always pay back their karmic debts! I am Canadian, so I'm not sure if that makes things tricky. Cheers!

Just got fired, nothing to eat but ramen, when it rains it fucking pours.
Yeah, sob story, deal with it. I need somewhere to vent and at least here I might get a pizza out of it.

My boss just fired me over the phone because I "can't keep up with the workload". After a month. And no warning whatsoever, just "Nope, sorry kid, you're out". Hopefully I can draw unemployment.

On top of that, we're about to have to find new living arrangements (The house we're in is being sold by the owners, it's complicated) and I'm now without any form of income so I guess I'm moving in with my boyfriend's parents.

I feel like a fucking loser and just want something to cheer me up a bit. I've posted like 5 requests over the last few years and only had one person answer. Doesn't leave much faith in humanity. :/

Just help out an old bitter asshole, please. Show me everyone in this world doesn't fucking suck.

Hi RAOP. I'm currently studying for an organic chemistry 2 midterm that is tomorrow morning and I'm getting every single problem wrong. I know it's stupid, but I'm just really stressed (which triggers my depression yay) and I could really use some pizza to cheer me up. I'm in Berkeley, CA.

Broke college student. Played in the sun all day and missed dinner.
Hello! It was the first beautiful day of the year today and I spent ALL of it outside enjoying the sunshine! Which was so much fun and I'm so glad I did. However, the bad thing is, I missed dinner at the cafeteria. I would greatly appreciate any contribution you could make to me, as I only have 3 dollars to my name at the moment. If it means anything to you, I attend Clarion University of Pennsylvania.

Well gang, the food stamps have run out, and I'm down to my last bowl of ramen noodes with instant potatoes in them. While this is indeed delicious and sustainable, I am now out of such ingredients. A pizza would be simply marvelous.

[Well... just about! ](http://imgur.com/s3VpvlF) Which means I haven't truly tasted pizza in over 4 years. Just think, that pizza you send me could be the point of no return for me! How could I start smoking again after that first slice of cheesy goodness? I'm in PA, got the big 3 in my area! Also, this will be a good way to test if QuitNow! is accurate!

Friend says I should treat myself to a pizza. (Salt Lake City)
It's been a rough day. I've been dealing with an abusive family member. I made some dinner, but it wasn't very good so it went in the garbage. My friend said I should treat myself to a pizza, but I'm tight on money, so I told her I'd make a request here. Kudos to you guys one way or the other.

Edit: Purely stylistic revisions because the writing was driving me nuts.

I'm getting really hungry.
Hey all, I'll keep this as to-the-point as possible. I'm a single guy who works security in Ottawa, ON, Canada. My money didn't carry me until the next paycheck, and I haven't eaten since last Wednesday. Now, this isn't an "end of the world" situation, seeing as I will get paid in three days, I am just finding it hard to function at the moment. It's currently 23:36 my time (I'm working), but being able to get off work at 11 am and get home and actually eat something would feel amazing.     
     
I do not have a preference of topping, or size, or brand. I'm not picky, and I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth. Once I get paid, I'd be more than happy to pay it forward. I'm willing to do any verification necessary. If there is anything wrong with my submission, please let me know so that I may change it.    
    
Thanks for taking the time to read, have a nice evening/day/morning!

A humble ginger looking for pizza
The title basically says it all. I'm really hungover/still drunk after my work's staff party last night and I'm in that purgatory between paychecks, exacerbated by the fact I'm in that purgatory between moving out of one flat and into another.

I know there are other people that probably deserve it more but I could really murder a pizza; plus I'm pretty sure the Papa Johns near me is doing a large pizza for £10 and that'll probably feed me til Friday.

Please and thank you.

Pregnant, broke, and the only thing that sounds good is pizza. (Wichita, KS)
Hey everybody! 

I'll be sure to return the favor when I get money. I had to do some repairs on my car, and that's why I'm unfortunately broke. I've been cursed with morning sickness and exhaustion, and pizza sounds like the only thing that wouldn't make me barf.

Posted a few days ago but going to try again.
The last few days all I've been having is eggs cause it's only thing that I can afford food wise, I got paid last Thursday but most of the pay check went to bills, currently I'm expected to move at the end of May so finding another job around here for more hours is probably not worth it. Just really bummed out and could use a pick me up. I think the papa johns or pizza hut forgot which one is doing a promotion on ordering online or something.

I know it's a long shot but hopefully can help, thank you for taking the time to read this, I really appreciate it.

Nova Scotia Canada - Have my son tonight would love to get him pizza
Hey guys! After a crummy first 3rd of 2015 I'm finally taking some vacation time. To celebrate I have my son visiting from my ex wife's place all week. I don't get paid until tomorrow so I've got pretty basic bachelor food in the house right now.  If possible I'd love to get a pizza for my son and I so we can start our father-son time on an awesome note. I'm in a small town so the only pizza places nearby are Grecos and Pizza Delight franchise places and a family owned place called Mimie's. Thanks in advance to whoever can get us pizza :D

I work and go to school full time, it's been tough this semester since I get no financial aid.

Hello Tampa redditor, here! I've never used this subreddit before and would really appreciate it if you lovely people could send my roommates and I some pizza.

In need of a pizza in San Francisco, while stressing out a background check.

--------- 


I'm sitting here sweating and stressing over a background check for a great job. 

&amp;nbsp; 

Unfortunately, I've been living on no income and fumes waiting for this gig and am in serious need of a pizza today. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am requesting pizza for one in San Francisco, CA. There are both Dominoes and Pizza Huts in the neighborhood. 

&amp;nbsp; 


Hopefully all is A-OK in the registration department. 

Please let me know if any info is needed. 

Thanks; any help will be highly appreciated! 



Edit: I am still in need of this pizza on Saturday! My background check is still going keeping me stuck with nothing.

We're just really hungry and I hit the random sub button. Now we're here.
Our rent check bounced while we were on vacation in Colorado. Once we got back we sent our landlord a cashiers check to be safe. we only had 7 bucks left afterwards since the bank took our grocery money for fucking up. We spent that Monday.  

Yesterday we combined change and each got a burger at Burger King. My girlfriends been doing homework all day. I think she's pissed I'm on reddit instead of hustlin the streets for cash or something.  We both don't get paid until Friday. The ironic part is that if we wouldn't have bought a little weed to bring back right before we left, we'd have enough for food instead of just being double hungry. I literally just stumbled onto this sub randomly and figured I better take a shot at it.  There's no way this actually works but either way this sub is dank.

Hi, my brother and I would love to get a pizza tonight but neither of us really have any money to our names. There's not much to have around here either, with most of it being cheap store-brand junk food . I'd prefer Pizza Hut, if possible. Will pay it forward one day. Thanks in advance!

Sweetest boyfriend ever still deserves a pizza.
As I have posted before, I have the sweetest boyfriend on the planet. He is the most generous person I have ever met.. with both friends and strangers. He is going through a lot right now due to epileptic seizures and stress. I have just started a new job with a brand new business and have still not gotten my paycheck.  My morale is low, but he is trying to stay positive for both of us. Could you help me reward him with a pizza? He deserves that, and so much more. Please help. We don't have a car, so the only option here is Dominos. We will pay it forward next month when we have pizza money to share. Thank you!

Life has been hard the last few months. Broke and craving. Have promo code but no monies.
Im getting divorced. I've lived 3 different places in the last 5 months. My ex-roommate killed my cat, the only source of joy and resilience I had left. I worked with him so I quit my job. My friend is keeping a roof over my head and internet on my computer, but I've been living on rice, beans, and kale for 2 weeks now. I'm craving a cheap hot pizza while I look for jobs on craigslist. I have a dominos promo code for a large with unlimited toppings for 10.99 but no money. This is the first time I've tried this. C'mon reddit... be awesome for me today!

according to my mom i spend too much of my own money, that i earn, on food.  which is ridiculous.  but my mom felt the need to call me yesterday and yell at me, and told me to stop spending money on food, which now means my only option for meals is our terrible cafeteria which is only getting worse as the year comes to a close.  (literally i was shitting buckets last night after some bad potatoes.  please help a home girl out.)

months pregnant, single, and desperately craving cheesy meaty saucy heaven on a crust
{{using my best friend's account because she is a redditor and I used to be but forgot what my username even was}}

I'm 7 months into uploading my son into the world and while many things said about pregnancy are just myths, the emotionally- damaging, near painful cravings are not. Tonight it has manifested itself as a desire for pizza, and I have not wanted anything so badly in quite a while. I am in the USA, specifically Georgia. Love 💖💖💖

Working for non-profit catching up
Hey guys,

I've always been one to lurk around here and just browse the different stories and watch people get pizzas, though working for a non-profit (little pay) is catching up with me and after paying for my car registration, big heating gas bill AND rent all coming out at once, I'm running a bit short. I work for a public access TV Station (501c3 Non-profit). I make enough money to live off of easily, its just ALL these bills landed in the same paycheck pay period.

Its not a sob story, I could *technically* afford a pizza, but I really dont want to leave myself struggling for money in case something really important or an emergency comes up. Just being honest.

I appreciate it and will happily repay with a pizza or something down the road. No need for delivery as I can go pick it up if need be.

I live in the central New Hampshire area.

Thank you!

All my money went into cleaning my bathroom and bedroom from the sewage leak in my building
My toilet flooded overnight , soaking everything in my bathroom and a sizable chuck of my bedroom carpet floor with sewage. I spent more money than I liked on products to clean everything as thoroughly as possible, cutting into my food fund. The people I hired to do the rug did indeed sanitize it, while also removing a large bit of the padding underneath (not its just rug, concrete). Its just a stressful situation a little bit.

[UK] - My bank f**ked me in the arse and other reasons why today sucked. Pizza would be awesome.
I have the house to myself this weekend and I was looking forward to settling into an afternoon of chilling out, drinking beer and having a pizza... Until I got a letter from my bank saying they're removing my overdraft, leaving me massively in debt with no money to speak of. YAY! Now I'm annoyed and sans pizza or beer but my cats have been fed at least.

IN 46201] Hungry Gamers. No tragedy, just gamers gaming.
Three adults. One (me) going gray rapidly teaching the other to use Steam...he brought a Humble Bundle, I'm walking him through creating a Steam account and using it. This is slow going, as he's not A1 in computer literacy. Other human is playing Guild Wars 2 and having a blast, it would seem. Cats litter the room, mostly asleep, but they are not in line to be fed any pizza.    
Any pizza place would do. We mainly use Pizza Hut, like Papa John's. would like to try Toppers. We'd prefer to avoid Dominoes, bad experiences from the local one.

the title is pretty self-explanatory, but my debit card was stolen an emptied before i was even alerted by my bank. WHAT TYPE OF BANK DOESN'T GET WEIRDED OUT BY A PURCHASE MADE IN THE FUTURE?!

(Canada) Final Push
hi, first off thanks for taking the time to read my post, and for being the kind of person who supports this altruistic sub!

My story is pretty simple, a couple months ago I lost my job. Don't feel to badly though. I had savings and am finishing university. So it could have been a lot worse. I ended up stretching out my budget far past where I ever thought it could go (thanks to some fun contests on campus, I got a months supply of ramen). But as the days wind down so do my precious noodles..

The good news is all hope is not lost. I just got hired in a new position waiting tables, and I looks like a good place to be for w while. This is where my request comes in. I've got one more final exam this year (Monday) and as such I don't start working until that night. That also happens to be my birthday (yes I can prove it)!

I've hit bottom, but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, if any of you kind folks can be the great person that give me an early birthday present id be forever greatful, and pay it forward as soon as I can fill my own fridge.

Again, Thank you all for your time in just reading this. And if you see someone worse off than me, please send to them instead. I can manage a meal tonight if I must, but I know there are plenty of others out there who can't

Pizza request for temporarily broke single mom in Florida with 2 kids as the post office has delayed my child support checks this month :(
Basically what the title says :( I had two surprise problems happen this month that left me using my savings (new tires and my molar broke). I get child support checks at the beginning and middle of the month. This month I never received my first one and I called the clerk of courts who faxed me a paper to fill out, notarize, and mail to Tallahassee which I did but I won't see that new check until they get that form. That was on the 14th and the lady told me the second check was mailed out THAT morning but for some reason it isn't here yet either!! I am dead broke and running out of food so if there is ANY way a nice stranger could get us a pizza to eat we could eat that for 2 days and hopefully our check will arrive. When I get paid on the 1st I will definitely pay it forward and help someone else out.

Broke and depressed.
No sob story, just being real. I've been pretty depressed lately, idk if it's the gloomy weather, money issues, or just random, untriggered depression, all I know is, I feel like crap. Im hoping some comfort food can help snap me out of my funk, so here I am, at RAOP. All of the major chains are fairly close to me, but if it would be at all possible, it would be SUPER awesome if a Pizza-er would send the money via paypal so I can transfer it to my Google wallet and then get a pie from mine and my wife's favorite local place, [Carmine's Pie House](http://carminespiehouse.com/)

Im not being picky by any means, I would even be grateful for a Little Caesar's Hot N Ready, I just want some of that salty, cheesy, greasy comfort that only a nice hot pizza pie can provide.

Whether or not anyone can help me out, thanks to anyone who reads this.




**Edit:** It has been brought to my attention that it would probably be easier for someone to simply call Carmine's and place the order than for me to do the convoluted plan I had come up with, so that is an option as well :)  Thanks

Recent college graduate in a new town for a new job.
Just like the title says I just moved to a new town for a new job. I haven't really worked enough to make a solid paycheck and a lot of my funds have been drained from the move. My diet has consisted of peanut butter sandwiches and water. I saw this subreddit and my mouth immediately started to water. I love all types of pizza from all places. I'm definitely considering checking this subreddit out more often cause I love pizza and I wanna share that love with others just like someone might with me :)

I live in Milledgeville, GA, and I've been super broke for awhile and really want some pizza. Between school and work I've been super stressed, and not having a lot of income hasn't exactly helped.

Broke until Friday (BUT NEW JOB! YAY!)
Hello there. I'm in a bit of a bind right now, my boyfriend was laid off, just got a new job, but we've been living off my savings for the last two months and this is about the end of it. A pizza before he goes back to work would really make our night. Will pay it forward, as usual.
Much gratitude!

[San Francisco] Food banks are closed on Sunday. Please help, we haven't eaten today.
Really desperately need food for 2 people. Will take absolutely anything!    
    
To lighten the mood a bit...in return I'll draw anything you want on the box and take a picture with it :-D    
    
Edit: I also have Google Wallet and even like $2 would help me get something from the dollar store. I live in my car though so I can't cook.

More Pizza4Kiva! $25 in Domino's and I'll lend out $50 to a Kiva member in need
Hey guys. Several months ago I gave this a shot, and it worked out really well. I got pizza and someone on Kiva got $50. I tried it again two months after, and another generous soul contributed for me to lend out another $50. Much thanks to /u/PizzusChrist and the other user (who has since deleted their username).

If you don't know what Kiva is, check it out. Here's a link to my lender profile: http://www.kiva.org/lender/css (I added a section saying hi to Reddit as verification)

I've lent a bit over $1200 on Kiva so far. Here's a screenshot of my portfolio: http://puu.sh/eTv1R/a6a2c09604.png

No sad story for you guys. My situation has improved a lot since my first post here. I'm down to lend double the amount that anyone is willing to put my way in the form of a Domino's gift card to anyone. I've got a little over $50 in my Kiva account, so an amount of $25 or below would be ideal (but I'm not complaining if you offer more).

You can pick who I'll lend to: http://www.kiva.org/lend - I'll reply back with proof of the loan, and you'll see them appear in my user profile. I'll post it all here so everything is legit.

Thanks to anyone who gives this consideration!

Just finished a huge term paper. Would love pizza
Ive posted here before with nothing to show for it. In one i talked about having a ton of hw to do leaving me unable to help my brother with his hw. Well tonight i finished my hw. It was a huge paper on a political issue. I had to describe both sides. Im in high school but take college classes as well. It was A HUGE percentage of my grade and i finished. Would love a pizza to celebrate. I have honestly never been prouder of my work then right now. If you read this, thank you. Im just really happy now.

Meal Plan ran out, bank account empty until tomorrow, will be able to repay you next week.
Hey, college freshman here. Just started this semester, first time ever using a meal plan. Didn't plan accordingly and am stuck without food until tomorrow. If you buy me a pizza today, I can buy you one next week (around Tuesday).

Also....if anyone has any fav episodes of MST3k, lemme know what ones ya love! I'm up for suggestions on which ones to watch.

Someone has broken into my house
I'm hiding in the closet right now.  I've been in here for several hours or maybe a day or so.  I don't know who this guy is but he's walking around calling for me.  I'm terrified.  I'm just waiting for the right moment to escape this closet to freedom.  But until that, all I can do is sit here and wait for him to find me.

All of this worrying has made me quite hungry.  So I hatched this plan.  Kill two birds with one cheesy stone, so to speak.  (See what I did there?  Hatched, killing birds, ha!)

I need someone to send a pizza guy to my house.  When this home-invading-maniac goes to answer the door, I escape the closet and me and the pizza guy jump him.  It would be helpful if the pizza was from pizza hut or dominos because all their pizza guys are ex-cons who know how to make a shank (or is it a shive?) out of cardboard.

Please hurry, you guys are my only hope :( If he hears my tummy growling, he might find meeeee

Pizza as an early birthday gift?
It's a classic end of the month, broke person scenario. Things aren't going so well, but I won't bore you with the details of my sob story (unless you want me to, for some reason). My birthday is coming up really soon, and the gift of pizza would be much appreciated. I'll even make you a cool digital drawing as a trade, if you like!

[Clearwater, FL.] Young couple who are tired of rice and desperate. Playful Pics For Pizza! :)
Male 24, and female 19 here. So the way this will hopefully work is you gift the pizza, and we send the pics privately or publicly if sfw. Want to see F feeding M a slice of pizza with her feet, just ask! Or how about us attempting to act out Romeo and Juliet's Act 2 Scene 3? You have the creative control here, we are just hungry and looking for a fun way to eat something decent with the funds at an all time low! PM with your ideas and I'm sure we will work something out ;D

Caretaker here, having my special friend over my place today, LOVES pizza... Just realized I'm out of Digorno! (CALIFORNIA)
Hey guys, I'm having my "special friend" over to my place today because they are fumigating his place and usually when we come here I have Digorno (store bought home baked pizza) and he really looks forward to that. This week I forgot to turn in my time card on time and will be getting paid 2 weeks late so I don't have any money to go get one. I do have food so please don't think I'm implying we will go starving but I just think it would be fun to see if we can find someone to pizza us today. 

Around our town I know we have Round Table, Mountain Mikes, Pizza Hut and Papa Murphys as our more well known places as well as Ricks NY Style Pizza as the local joint (if you're the type that likes to help out mom and pop) 

I should have him inbetween 1pm and 6pm today my time. So if there is any possibility just give me a shout and I'll try and surprise him. :) 

Thanks a lot.

would be a blessing right now.
I wouldn't normally like doing this but I'm pretty desperate right now. So i'm gonna tell my story. I have a severe disorder and depression,  I am trying to seek help but its hard to do anything with my condition. I have a roommate who is disabled, we met about 2 years back and became best friends. We ended up becoming co-dependent on each other after a while of knowing each other. I moved in with him because he couldn't take care of himself physically and I couldn't survive on my own mentally. It worked out for a while we have food stamps for food and i've been helping him with his disability paperwork and such trying to get us to survive,  I can't work due to my panic attacks I get them whenever I feel anxiety pretty much and don't have medication for it but I am trying to see a doctor for it hopefully I can also get some disability but that isn't the important part of this story. Right now me and my roommate we have been cutoff from out goverment benefits and we have no food and my roommate has no Medicaid to see a doctor for his pain anymore. I called the local food stamps place but they said we had to do a forum they sent out to us and I couldn't get it to come in faster and it's been days since we had a good meal besides ramen, and pizza would be a great blessing at this point. Also I forgot to include this one bit but I might as well try to sell myself as much as possible but today also happens to be my birthday. I was born April 22, 1991. I was told about this subreddit by my cousin who lives out of town and he said you guys might be able to help me out since I don't know when I will be able to get food again but I don't know when. If you guys also have any ideas to help with my current living situation id also appreciate it!

A pie would make my night (or week rather)
I have just paid rent, and my credit card bill. I haven't been getting what I normally get in my paycheck because of spring break screwing up my work schedule. I am currently working on my university capstone, a fifteen page thesis, and an eight page report all due by next week and i've been living on ramen for two days. If someone could help me out, I would appreciate it. I am currently located at Morgantown, WV.

Again, thank you for any consideration.

Job interview tomorrow need something to eat to get me feeling good to nail it.
I put this in food_pantry also but wanted to try here for something for tonight hopefully so I am full and feel good to nail my interview tomorrow. 1. Double charged by paypal 2. Son bought something without permission and refund didnt go back in quick enough 3. Lost my son's car payment he gave me in cash. It fell out of my wallet somewhere so it came out of my account without anything going in to cover Between those 3 things our bank account got with $480 in overdraft fees since we didn't know what was going on until it was too late. So now we have absolutely no money for food until our next checks on 5/1. Don't need much just a couple loaves of bread and hot dogs would make us get through. We have some canned side items but not much in the way of proteins. If you need the sympathy part We lost my mother-in-law 3 years ago, my wife (his mother) 1.5 years ago. Had one uncle pass away last week, a great uncle passed away today and a third in the hospital with cancer. All of that causing me no small amount of stress. On the upside I do have a great job interview tomorrow. Thanks for even reading just typing and putting it out there relieves a little bit of stress.

Lost my debit card and bank is closed to take out cash. Pizza would be nice. Tennessee
I lost my debit card after an awful day at work and they closed the bank in my city so I can't get cash out till tomorrow. So I thought I would give this a try. Dominos is the only place that will deliver to my house if anyone wants to help. In a week when I hopefully get my debit card back in the mail I would love to pay it forward.

Getting a divorce, and my wife drained my account. I'm kinda hungry but won't get paid for a bit.
So basically, as the title stated, I'm getting a divorce. My wife, being the loving person that she is, opened a new bank account and transferred all of our money into it from our joint account, leaving me with nothing. She's thoughtful though, so she made sure to leave all of the automatic bill payments on the account with no money and crush me with overdraft fees.

I will be fine come next Friday, but until then I have no money. I was hoping that maybe one of you guys saw me around and liked what I do, and would be willing to help me out.

Edit: I will pay it forward as soon as I can. Right now, I don't have much to offer. I will send 250 dogecoin to whoever is kind enough to help me out here.

First timer, couple between jobs, tired of rice. [Phoenix, AZ]
Howdy. New to this stuff. Was told by fiancee who is craving pizza to post here, check if we're lucky. Honestly I have no idea what I'm doing, but I think I'm within the rules. 

She recently got hired, but until she gets her first paycheck in a few weeks, we're living off of scraps (beans and rice mostly). I'm studying and preparing to leave after the semester's over to work a summer job out of the country. 

It'd be nice to have some delicious pizza one of these days while we're still in the same area, and I reckon we can pay it forward once we have our finances sorted out again.

If you're feeling generous and considering to send us something, we're 2 people and we live in the Ahwatukee area.

[Here's the injury] for those who want to see it. Not for the easily disturbed.

While asking for a pizza is not random, I'm asking for someone to send me a randomly topped pizza. Be it your favorite flavor or just something crazy. I get paid tomorrow and will be paying it forward, in the same style. I am in Iowa, and there are two chain stores Pizza hut, and dominoes.

Pizza for psychology class
Hey reddit, my psychology class is doing an event to build awareness on campus for homelessness. Tonight, we're spending the night outside surviving off whatever we can get other people to bring us. It'd be super cool if we got pizza sent our way from one of you.  In return for pizza, I'm willing to snapchat you pictures of the event. We've got dominoes and pizza hut near within delivery distance. Thanks in advance guys!

Agoraphobic went out today, NEEDS to celebrate somehow, broke
The shortest version is that I am requesting a pizza. I live in Erlanger, Kentucky, I am feeding 3 people.

The short version is that I've had agoraphobia for a few months where I didn't leave the house. I shouldn't say had, because I still have it, but I have been working hard to control it and get out in the world. The day was beautiful, but every place we went something went wrong*, so I was out for 6 hours. It wasn't supposed to take that long, but I somehow made it through. I am so proud of myself I can't even explain! 

But, I am broke, so I am requesting pizza so I have some way to celebrate such a momentous occasion! I finally know that I am getting better, and I will beat my illness. 


*if you request, I will tell the story.

Edit: I am on reddit now if anyone has any questions.

10 hours into project, won't be paid until complete (estimated 100 hours total)
After I get paid, I then need to wait for check to clear. Almost nothing left in pantry, fridge has a jar of pickle water and two slices of ham which will otherwise be dinner for tonight. Doing okay on ramen and rice but I'd be lying if I said I felt energetic or enthused haha, would be incredibly grateful for a pizza or two to chew on for the next week.

Massachusetts, USA. 

I will gladly trade MS paint drawings of whatever you want in exchange for the 'zza, but won't have time to draw anything until May 1st (project deadline). I can also provide voice acting for whatever you need (I have an Australian accent and am female). Thanks for reading xx

from Indiana - Dinner and a movie?
Hello fellow RAOP-ers!

I'm not here to post a sob-story or anything of the like. I am a graduate student in a medical field who has 4 cumulative finals next week and a 4-hour, 200-question cumulative test over the last 2 years of my program a couple week later. Needless to say, my life is going to be consumed by studying for the foreseeable future. I'm not looking for pity because I love the field I am in, and all of this studying will be worth it...eventually. I'm just looking to cut down on my time spent cooking/cleaning this weekend.

**Anyway, here is my idea: You supply the pizza and pick *any movie* and after I finish studying, I will watch it tonight while enjoying the pizza you provided!** 

It can be your favorite movie, a movie from your childhood, or even a movie that you hated and want to make someone else suffer through like you did! I request that the movie is online somewhere because I don't want to buy/rent a movie from iTunes. I have Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu Plus subscriptions, so if the movie is on one of those streaming services, even better! I can do a search for less....legal...options as well, but I would prefer not to, if at all possible. After I watch it, I can provide my own *personal review* of the movie if you are interested in how I felt about it. I can post it here as a follow-up comment, PM it to you privately, or post a [Thanks] mentioning your username and proof of delicious pizza.

Please don't pick one of those [movies that is ridiculously long](http://nofilmschool.com/2014/07/72-minute-trailer-720-hour-30-day-movie-anders-weberg)...have mercy on me.

I would be looking to get a carryout pizza from Papa Johns around 6:30-7pm EDT, and, if you are interested, I have some codes that can save some money.

**TL;DR** If you buy me a pizza, I will watch any movie of your request tonight and provide either a brief or detailed movie summary/review at your request!

It's been a lousy week and I need something good.
Totaled my car, have a disarticulated right ankle, so I can't drive anyway and I'm out of work for about a month. My fiance doesn't know how to cook and I forgot to have him take something simple out of the freezer. We're both depressed as hell and would love some pizza. We can both eat for less than $20 but it has to be Dominoes since they're the only ones that deliver.

Not enough food to feed the calorie meter
I've been working on eating back the calories I work off, but I pretty much only have low fat, low cal foods except for a few things that take too much energy to cook. 

Pizza seems to be the easiest way to get calories the fastest. I've been sitting here trying to think of 2000 calorie meals, but it's just not happening. 

If not, I was thinking of just drinking some butter. 

Thanks and stuff.

Trying to close out a rough week, half looking for pizza half just looking to vent...
So, I was unemployed for a little while due to some serious b.s. but I was able to land a new job a couple of months ago as the head chef in a pretty nice bar / restaurant in a seasonal town but it wasn't good. Me and my wife both agreed I needed to quit for various reasons. I know, it wasn't the brightest idea but having to pay a babysitter for the amount of hours I was working / traveling didn't add up to the amount of money I was making, also some other reasons that I woudln't even write about in my personal diary I quit.

Well, last Tuesday night we were in the mood to celebrate a little bit since my wife was finally able to get off of overnights and work days and the fact that we weren't going to be able to do anything fun again in a little while we figured we'd drive to the nearest city (Watertown) have some dinner and catch a movie allowing our 11 year old to stay up a little late.

The night went by fine, we ate a chain restaurant that's known for it's BBQ and saw Insurgent - all in all a decent family night out. The movie ended about 9:00pm so we had to get back home so the kiddo could go to bed and get some sleep.

Terrible night starting in... 5...4...3...2...1...

I pulled up to a caution light where I had to stop and turn left onto a highway and there was a sheriff who turned right down the road I was just coming off from. I didn't think anything of it made my left turn and went along my way.

A few minutes later, there's flashing lights in my rearview and I'm on the side of the road handing over my license and registration. He informs me that the little light above my license plate was out, and that warranted the stop ( I didn't even know there was a light there ). So, fine, he'll give me a fix it ticket and we'll be along our way in no time.

About 30mins later he comes back and notifies me that my license is suspended due to a ticket that I had received months ago that I had completely forgotten about in a different small town. Great. My wife doesn't drive, so she can't take my car, and he wont wait for any of my friends to come get car since they all live an hour away.

He pulls me out of the car and cuffs me, leads me to the back of his cruiser and there I sit. He gets on his computer and arranges a tow truck (which took about an hour to get there) to haul off my car. He wouldn't leave the car in my wife's care till someone was able to come.

Apparently this entire time she's in the front seat of my car bawling talking to her mother getting her to come get her and our daughter while I sit there and twiddle my thumbs he prints out my tickets and goes and tells my wife everythign that's going to happen.

Eventually, the tow truck shows up, and a state trooper to sit with my wife and wait for her mother and we're off towards the nearby town court so I can go in front of a judge at 10:30 at night. Yup, I'm sure this is going to go well.....

The sheriff tells me the judge will probably let me off on ROR till my court date since I only have the one problem. The sheriff was wrong. It's about 11pm before we get to the courthouse and the judge quickly informs me that he's going to lock me up and that I'll need bail money to the tune of $300.

I'm able to call my wife and let her know that they're taking me back to Watertown (about 20-30 mins away) and taking me to jail and that there's bail set.

.......... I've never even been in the backseat of a cop car, never been in handcuffs, none of this. I strive to not break the law so I don't wind up in jail, because quite frankly I'm a bit of a pussy and would be nothing short of "fresh fish" in that situation. Needless to say, I was freaking out a little bit.

It's also important to mention that I'm not really a small fellow. I love rich foods, and I love to eat, and my nerdy hobbies leave me pretty immobile when I'm not working. I'm a fat guy. The back of a cop car? Not made for us bigger folk. No way, no how. Up until this point it had been okay because the sheriff had kept me handcuffed in the front.

Going back out to his car before the car ride to Watertown he informs me that the station won't accept me like this and I have to put my hands behind my back. It took two sets of cuffs for me to be handcuffed. Climbing in the back of the cop car was more like me jumping in and flopping on the backseat and laying on my hand for the 20-30 minute drive.

It's almost midnight now and I have to somehow get out of the back of this cop car. I end up flopping like a dying fish to climb out and next thing I know I'm taking my shoes off putting my hands on little black squares and getting felt up by a dude built like a linebacker. Then I'm in a jail cell.

fuck.

There's some drunk guy peacocking and flipping me off, some dude obviously coming down from... something. A quiet person, and what I'm guessing is a moderatly attractive hooker ( I really have no idea other than she was a younger female ).

The good news? I only sat there for a few minutes before they told me my wife was there and it'd only be about 30 mins to do all the paperwork before I could leave.

So, I go about getting my picture taken, answering a bunch of questions about how I don't feel suicidal still under the not so subtle gaze of Watertown's finest on a Tuesday evening. Oh, and let's not forget the tattoo'd SGT telling the others how bad he wants to tune up the guy that's coming down from something.

fml, I don't belong here.

Now here I am having to pay $300 to get my car out of the tow yard, the $300 bail money (some amount we'll get back after my court date) and we're now broke till she gets paid next week, and who knows how much all my fines are going to add up being.

Also, apparently the whole unlicensed driver thing is a misdeamor and I can spend some time in jail? WTF.

So, yeah... I don't want to have canned soup tonight, I'm picking up my wife from work soon (I've gotten my driving privilegas back) and I'd love to tell her we're able to get some pizza for dinner.

If you read, but can't (or just dont want to pizza me) thanks for reading anyway I know it's probably a longer post than the sub is used to.

....... sorry for my terrible spelling

17 year old that was kicked has no money until his paycheck comes in on Monday. Please pizza me.
I was kicked out of my house by my mother. Was on the street for a while and now I'm working a PC repair gig and have my own shitty apartment.


Well rent came and now I have no money for food till Monday night.


I think you can see where I'm going with this.


I dont know what I can give back to you if you would give me some delicious pizza but I can try and think of something.


Thank you for even reading!

I will serenade you for pizza!
I'm in college and am moving to my first apartment ever tomorrow. I know I'm going to be strapped for cash, because all of the money I have saved up is going towards rent. I'd really like to have someone buy my first meal. So to thank you for it, I will sing a song of your choice (that I know). (: I will also send a pic of my cheesy deliciousness if you're so inclined. Thank you in advance!

Miserable depressed hung over asshole needs a pizza. &lt;3
Last night I went to a party, had a bit too much drinks then I should've (people kept offering it to me left right and centre, I tried refusing but they are stubborn and I am a stupid doormat). Anyway when I got home I got into a fight with my family, a lot of bullshit happened and I'm really feeling down from it, I've got nobody to go to or anyone that cares. My boyfriend and I had a huge fight as well and I had a break down because he compared me to my mother (which he knows is way to far and something nobody ever dares say to me; and even then I feel like I'm nothing like her). There is so much external shit and problems going on. There was a bitch at a party who was my friend but back stabbed me many times until my boyfriend put his foot down and made me tell her to fuck off and refuse to talk to her which helped me. She was starting shit; saying nasty things and being a bitch but I didn't want to start a fight there, it was my mates party and I felt bad about doing so.

All I want is to rot in this hell of my bedroom and have one simple enjoyment (and a helpful cure to this miserable hang over) is a warm pizza from dominos. I can understand they're might be people in worse situations but I really could go for one. I only have 15 AUD. I would've gotten it myself but I'm broke and I know my parents won't buy me one let alone care about me/love me.

Oooo, a person! Oh wait, nevermind. It's a computer screen. Hiii!

I honestly don't have much of a story, other that I'm hungry and sick. Pizza sounds great right now, and I'm far too broke for that as I'm saving up for a renovation. Buy me pizza, and I'll forever have a place in my heart reserved for you. &lt;3

I hate this. I hate asking for this. But if you want to help, I'm in wichita falls TX. There are 3 chains about equally as far from me. Papa Johns, Dominos, and Pizza hut.

Pie to stretch last few bucks
Just spent a fairly hefty chunk of change to move this weekend. Got just enough cash left to string by until payday, but a pie would definitely help buffer that.

Can definitely pay it forward again with my next check, since I'll have quite a bit of backpay from a raise I just got finalized. Maybe I'll get 3 random pies because raises are awesome (and to be honest, my first raise ever in my entire working career)

No food- and my final is due today
I am so hungry. I've been eating 1 meal a day for the last week. I'm out of money. I'm waiting on a small freelance payment to come through, waiting to see if my interview got me a job. My take home final is due today and it is soooo hard to get answers right when my mind is all lalalala.

I have a verification code- that is cool. 

I would be so thankful. I live in Chicago, IL. I believe Dominoes delivers here. And a zillion others, but I know they do.

This is not a sob story. (Canada)
While I have nothing against those who come to this sub with tragic stories, this is not one of such posts.

Here is my not-so-sad story!

For the past year, my boyfriend and I have been sharing an apartment with a girl who, quite honestly, we've nicknamed Voldemort. She's crazy, she steals, she makes ungodly amounts of noise at all hours of the night. I could tell you stories that would probably shock you. However, I'm a tolerant person, and frankly I was never overly bothered by this, but my boyfriend quite obviously was.

The good news comes here. She came to us this weekend and declared that she would be moving out! One of our close friends is looking for a new place, so not only are we getting rid of our evil roommate, but we're replacing her with somebody we absolutely adore, and who has spent countless nights with us at the apartment already.

Due to all three of us being students, and our friend currently saving for first and last, we don't really have any money to celebrate with.

So! I have come to you, reddit, to ask for a pizza to split among the three of us to enjoy Voldemort's destruction and the path to happier times. :)

am embarrassed to have to ask for help, but I am hungry.
Hello everyone. 

To make one of those long stories about pain, growth, and transcendence exceptionally short... I posted in an askreddit thread this past Friday about how I skipped a days worth of eating to buy my cat food because she ran out. This prompted a fantastic member of our community to send me some litter and cat supplies! She pointed me in the direction of this subreddit and here I am! I am a 28 year old male who recently returned home after being in treatment for over 3 months. To say the least, my life is the hardest it has ever been by a long shot. I have faith things will get better and I work hard to keep moving in a positive direction everyday. I received my first paycheck this past Friday and it is already gone so ordering a pizza on my own would be impossible. To be honest. Even if I did have money, pizza would be a luxury I could not afford right now. 

Could one of you please order me a pizza? My gratitude would be immense and I promise to enjoy every bite to the fullest.

Title says it all. I've been so busy going to interviews and transcribing interviews that I haven't had time to shop and I'm out of food. College is hard and money is tight. Starving artist (literally) could use something to eat

Agoraphobic went out Thursday, NEEDS to celebrate som
The shortest version is that I am requesting a pizza. I live in Erlanger, Kentucky, I am feeding 3 people.

The short version is that I've had agoraphobia for a few months where I didn't leave the house. I shouldn't say had, because I still have it, but I have been working hard to control it and get out in the world. The day was beautiful, but every place we went something went wrong*, so I was out for 6 hours. It wasn't supposed to take that long, but I somehow made it through. I am so proud of myself I can't even explain!
But, I am broke, so I am requesting pizza so I have some way to celebrate such a momentous occasion! I finally know that I am getting better, and I will beat my illness.

I made a request on Thursday ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/33ncpy/request_agoraphobic_went_out_today_needs_to/)), and even though I did have someone offer, I never received pizza. Would anyone be willing to help me out still?

College student with less than $0.70 to my name could use some 'za
My pantry is running very low and I won't get paid again until the 8th and, unfortunately, working a campus job paying federal minimum wage, paychecks are pretty miniscule considering I'm only allowed 3 hours a week (severe over-hiring). I could really just use a good pizza to comfortably chow down on tonight.

The best compensation I can offer is that I'll write and record you a short power metal song about a subject of your choosing. That and I will pay it forward to those who may need it when I have the means.

For the record I'm in Central Illinois. I'm not big on giving out location details publicly on the internet so if you'd like to know more specifics please PM me.

Thanks!

Pizza for a starving college student
Hey /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, 

I am a junior in college who has been working on papers for the past few weeks. I have hardly any money left in my bank account and I have been eating "Macaroni O's &amp; Beef"  cold, out of the can in the library.

I am swamped with school work so I can hardly work for money. When I do work, all that money goes towards bills. I am essentially out of money. 

I went from weighing 175 pounds to 160 pounds in the last 2 months from lack of nutrition. I need food.

Petersburg, FL) rice or ramen..
So, at the age of 24, I recently bought a house. I've spent the last of my savings fixing it up and still have a ways to go and am currently sitting here debating on eating rice or ramen.

Trying to put together a Board Game Night.
My wife and I are trying to start a biweekly board game night, and tonight is our first night. We are a bit strapped for cash right now after buying new games to play, and I was thinking some pizzas for the people who show up would help make the launch night a success. We are located in Jacksonville, FL and have all 3 of the main chains near us. 

Thanks to everyone taking the time to read this, and I hope you all have a kickass night!


Cheers,

Trying this one more time, I'm tired of eating rice and beans. Lexington, KY
I've posted on here before (yesterday in fact) with no results.  I'm an unemployed graduate student and writer. It's hard to find a job that I could keep during my erratic class schedule. I've tried getting a job with the university but any potential job there wouldn't start until August.

I mentioned this yesterday but I'll say it again. I'd be willing to trade my writing skills for a pizza. I'll write you a poem or 1-2 page short story inspired by the person, place, thing, or concept of your choice.

I have a verification code too.

Any help would be glorious and wonderful &lt;3

Mom left me and little brother without any food. Don't want him to starve.
So about an hour ago my mom along with the rest of my family to go to a little family gathering as a aunt from Alaska has came in. My mother told me to stay behind as my little brother Jake is too sick to go. She left and only gave me the instructions "make him some sandwiches" I finished up a game of LoL then went downstairs with promises of returned with a nice ham &amp; cheese for the little dude but was confronted with the grim realization that there was indeed NOTHING that was able to be made into any edible food. Now my mom claims she has no cash and neither do I. The pizza isn't really for me but my little brother. I just don't wanna see him starve.
I live in Texas.
Thank you.

home alone with the kids this upcoming weekend, and real pizza (as opposed to frozen pizza) would be a good change! Will poorly draw you something in return!
I am not an artist, but I enjoy the occasional stick-figure/abstract doodling when I can.  If you can hook my kids and I up with some REAL pizza for Saturday night, make a request and I'll draw you something in what my art teacher called "juvenile but charming" style!

Just got a job! Would love a pizza to celebrate!
I'm posting from my brother's account, we live together. I've been on disability for most of my adult life but I'm going to try and work part time now. I got a job at Walmart, they're paying 9 dollars an hour now!

Anyways, my brother and I would love a pizza if anyone could make it happen that would be awesome! I'm going to be watching Doctor Who with my brother and my 2 dogs for the rest of the day! A pizza would make today even better!

Thanks guys!

I would like a pizza, please!
Started a job last Tuesday, don't get paid until next week.  Haven't been able to "celebrate".  Not starving, though.

I live in Seattle, WA, and am near a Pizza Hut, a dominos, and a Papa Johns.  If needed, I can go pick it up.

Will pay it forward in a few paychecks.

I just want to celebrate the promotion, because I am horribly broke.
I recently got a new job, and I'm great at it, I like it, but it pays less than my last one. I got notice that I'm to talk with my manager about taking  the tier 2 position in a meeting Friday. 

I'm very excited and I'm also pretty hungry. I'd really appreciate a pizza if you can find it in your heart to share.

(Canada) In need of cheering up.
I recently been through a lot of stress in the past couple days. I moved in my new apartment in the beginning of April with my SO and 2yo boy, everything was smooth sailing. Until this past Monday, my parents show up with my siblings and 8 month old nephew needing a place to stay for the night because they would be moving into their house the following day, no biggie. So now there is 8 of us in my one bedroom apartment. Fast forward to today, there still here, my food is almost gone, the land lord found out about them and now pissed wants them out by Friday. So hopefully they get a place tomorrow. I don't want them to be homeless. A pizza would calm me down.

Portland, OR I kind of feel bad posting here....
But I'm pretty hungry at the moment and I'm not going to be able to shop for food until this weekend, as I'm broke until then but if anyone could help that'd be great. If they can't that that's okay too. 
Thanks for reading. :) 


edit: just so you know, my username isn't a joke. I don't think eating disorders are funny, and I'm still trying to work out my issues.

I had surgery a week ago, and my wife has done everything this week. I'd love to be able to do something for her with out her feeling guilty that we spent money.
Hi all,

Last Friday I had to go into the ER to get my appendix out.  This week I have been off work and basically just laying on the couch, because I'm not allowed to be up doing stuff.  This being said, my wife has been wonderful and has helped me with everything I need, and cooked dinner each night at home. I know if I ordered pizza on my own she would feel guilty that I spent money just for her, so I was hoping someone could help out so she didn't have to feel guilty. If anyone would be able to send a pie tonight, PM me. Thank you!!

Mayweather vs Pacquiao and Me vs Hunger :(
I'm a college kid here as a representative from a small group in North Texas who would SINCERELY appreciate a pie or two as we recover from finals and watch the big fight. In fact, we'd be willing to post said appreciation if you need proof! We're all broke from either rent or school but summers around the corner and hope is on the horizon. So if there's goodwill in your heart, please put pizza in our stomach.

PTSD anxiety + bipolar + mild atypical autism, need foods.
After I was mugged and chased by crackheads for ~12-6 hours straight I developed PTSD which makes moving around outside difficult, and induces small panic attacks for when I enter open areas, despite medication and therapy. 

I plan on paying forward the random act once I am able to pay for a pizza personally, Also can show pics of scripts as proof of diagnosis.

Found in central kansas.

Help Defeat Comcast with the Power of Pizza!
Greetings fellow pizza fanatics!

Today was a sad day for a pizza partier such as myself.  I recently moved into a new place after being a vagabond for a bit, and upon opening my forwarded mail was greeted w/ a rather unpleasant surprise.  Comcast appears to  have failed not only in canceling my service before I moved from my previous address, but is also attempting to charge me for a modem that I already returned.  Evidence below (used an oversized paperclip to cover the modem serial, b/c IDK what you folks are capable of w/ such information lol):

http://i.imgur.com/4wUqSLJ.png?1

So now I'm being charged not only for 3 months of service I didn't use and a modem I already returned, but also will surely have collectors blowing up my phone in short time as it has already been sent to collections.  I spent 3hrs on the phone w/ them earlier trying to figure out how to remedy the situation, but it's looking grim.  I will be sending an e-mail off tomorrow pleading my case and likely spend countless more hours on the phone, but w/o gooey sustenance I'm not sure if I can do it!

Based on the current status of my refrigerator, I am ill-prepared for this rumbling in my belly.  On the flipside, however, I am WELL prepared for a pizza party as any raop'er should be.

http://i.imgur.com/Q9ZZk79.png

Look at all those home-made pickled peppers waiting to top a pizza!  And artichokes!  And....bacon fat or miso soup concentrate or mayo or 3-day old lemon wedge :(

http://i.imgur.com/cmpiIVS.png

Look at all the hot sauces!  Every bite can be a new adventure through the streets of flavor town!

I will be sure to give a proper thank-you w/ pics of me enjoying the pizza party, as well as give back to the community in the form of free pizza.  Regardless of whether I get the charges refunded, I will run a contest entitled "Fuck Comcast, the pizza delivery guy is my service provider" in which I will give away free pizza to the best Comcast customer service horror story.

May the pizza gods shine down upon thee RAOPers

In pizza we trust

Broke from using money to help pay for girlfriends medical treatments and give her some type of wedding. Could really use some pizza.
Hey guys. We've been in a tough spot lately because my wife has a pancreatic disorder that requires regular treatment and such. She had to quit her job because of the illness, and upon finding out the disorder leads to (or could already be) pancreatic cancer, I've been saving up to give her a wedding with the little non-bill money we have, which means alot of pb&amp;j or dollar packs of hot dogs for meals. 

Fortunately, her grandmother's pastor just agreed to officiate for the wedding for free, and as a mini celebration, we were talking about how much a pizza would be a treat when I remembered this sub existed. Can anyone out there maybe lend us a hand? It would make for a great small way to celebrate some good news at a time where such things are rare for us. Thank you in advance, should any of you be so generous!

Pizza request from Cambridge, England.
Hey. I'm happy. This past month I've been eating well. I've been working hard on getting fit. Two days ago I became an Active Listener on 7cupsoftea, a website dedicated to listening to those in need. Why am I here? Well I've eaten pretty much chicken/rice fish/potato meals for almost a month now, and I can't afford a delicious pizza due to still being off work ill. Was wondering if someone out there was in a more fortunate situation to help me out? Many thanks! Simon.

you buy me a pizza today, i buy you one on friday plus i'll send you this sweet pentagram patch!
so i was unemployed and struggling for a while but i finally got a job at a law firm (yay!!). since i just started this past monday, i don't get paid for another week and my fridge/cabinets are as empty as my stomach. i haven't eaten since yesterday morning so a pizza would be amazing right now and would last me until payday. it would seriously make my week. which aside from starting my new job has been pretty awful- my grandmother, who was amazing, died and some other bad things happened but nothing as bad as losing her. :'(

this friday, i can either buy you a pizza or send it to someone of your choosing (after 5pm est which is when i get off work). i'll also send you this awesome pentagram pizza patch that my friend made. here is the patch: http://i.imgur.com/HVlWbiA.jpg

please, help a girl out? i could use some cheering up. plus i want to do something to return the favor i.e. send you a pizza and the sweet patch.

Basically, I had a make up exam today and somehow overslept and missed it. In the process of oversleeping and hurrying out the door, I leave my lunch at home and I can guarantee my brother's already nabbed it. Whoops.

That make up exam is hosted by a nice teacher, I'm sure I can get that fixed. But my lunch? Damn. Could appreciate some foodstuffs in circular format n.n

Girlfriend just broke up with me and completely caught me off guard. Not in the mood for cooking.
Greenwood NS, Canada

Hey guys. I'll keep this one short. 2015 Has not been the most servicable year for me. In January my marriage ended, I've been only seeing my son on weekends and needless to say it's not been fun.

The silver lining of this year was a beautiful, dependable, loving girlfriend with whom I had terrific dates, wonderful memories and great sex. She really was the whole package. 

Well out of nowhere today she decided to break up with me because "our lives are going in two different directions." To say it caught me completely off guard is the understatement of the year.

I'm not feeling the greatest right now. My ex-wife is letting my son visit tonight but I don't know if I'll be in the best mood to cook anything good.

Could use some pizza.

Thanks in advance guys

Edit - Wow 44 upvotes. Even though I haven't been pizza'd I really appreciate the support from all of you. Thank you guys!

Ontario, Canada - I hate asking without being able to give back but we're just in the final stretch of being flat broke and would really love a pizza to make the week better
My husband and I have had a rough few years of being buried in debt and trying to keep our heads above the water, while supporting our son.  We're down to our last $800 in debt which will be paid off in June when we get $1400 back that the government owes us, but thanks to our tight budget for now, we're down to two boxes of mac and cheese, a small pot of pasta, a can of tuna and a loaf of bread to last our family of three until Friday.  We have -$20 in the bank, so no grocery runs either. We'd really love a meal that isn't from a can to help keep our spirits up and remind that it's not much longer until we can stop living paycheck to paycheck.

Will draw things for pizza (also I'm verified)

Just moved back to college town and am exhausted from moving/restocking everything.
Hi all, this seems super interesting! I just moved back to my college town for the summer before moving to Germany for a year in the fall. I just feel pretty burned out from packing/unpacking and restocking all the things that I couldn't take with me.

My girlfriend and I split amicably yesterday due to my travel plans in the interest of remaining friends so I'm not depressed but that also happened!

There's an added level of irony in that my new roommate is a delivery driver.

I moved back from Detroit and while there's a great group of independent places there, I've been longing for some Papa John's for a while (if allowed to make requests).

I think I did the request right but please let me know if I didn't! Thanks!

TL;DR - Exhausted from very recent major life changes and would love some Papa John's!

Edit: I also just cut myself with a kitchen knife preparing a snack lol

Lookin' for some Star Wars Day za.
Long time giver and receiver here, lookin' to get some za to compliment a screening of the films later tonight, after class is out and my SO is finished working. 

Been working a new job alongside finishing up with the semester and have been quite busy and still awaiting my paychecks to catch up. Most of the money coming in now is covering overdue bills. Looking for some za now so I can pay it forward again later when the money comes in.

Excited for tonight, when I can escape into *a galaxy far, far away...* It's the little things in life.

Also, [this Force Awakens trailer with cats is too precious.](https://nerdist.com/geek-sundry-presents-star-wars-the-purr-awakens/)

Doing a year of service with no pay and super broke this month. Haven't been able to get home from mentoring middle schoolers tonight and would love to just snag some quick 'za to surprise my GF while we watch Star Wars tonight.
I'm currently doing a year of service and with bills/student loans etc, the small living stipend I receive hasn't been going very far this month. I've been budgeting fairly well but that doesn't allow for extravagances such as a delicious cheesy pizza.

I also mentor middle schoolers at an after school program, and it ran late tonight so I'm just heading home tonight, it's around quarter after 8 here  - so I'd really love to not have to cook.

Also, my girlfriend isn't going to be home until 9 and wants to watch Star Wars with me...so I'd love to surprise her with some pizza!

Thanks everyone, love the community.

Just got off a bad shift at my crisis center and would like something to cheer me up!
It's Monday, already a rather crappy day by most people's standards and I had what should've been a typical shift this evening at the crisis center I volunteer at. Well it was incredibly stressful and aggravating instead, plus I'm famished. A pizza would go a long way toward relieving some of that stress!

Ugh, today sucked. Work sucked. Went to urgent care and was told I have an ear infection. A pizza would really help cheer me up. It's not like I can't go make food, I just get in coughing fits every 5-10 minutes and it makes doing anything super difficult. I'll pay it forward when I'm feeling well enough to get out and put money on my card.

Today is a kind of red-letter day for us. We made our /last/ mortgage payment. The house is now ours and starting next month we're going to have free money for better food and maybe even a little luxury budget for each person! So HUZZAH that this milestone has been reached.    
Here's the problem: We have a dollar in the bank, until Thursday. Pickings in the cupboard are a bit slim. So we can't get celebratory pizza, or even go to the corner store for slushies.    
Can anyone help us out with Pizza Hut or Papa Johns? I have a lot of Pizza Hut coupons saved up.

Two friends of mine have died in less than a week, I'm broke until Friday and I'm extremely hungry and depressed.
I just found out this subreddit and what you all are doing is great. As for me, I'm not doing well emotionally. A friend of mine dropped dead of cardiac arrest last Thursday, and last night another friend hung himself. I've been living off ramen or just not eating entirely. If anyone could send me a pizza, it'd really help. Thanks.

Just moved to a new town, broke until I start my new job which I still have no start date for
Like the title says, I'm in a new town for a new job that still needs my background check to come back before I can start. I'm living off my parent's dime right now. The thing is, they're vegan and while I have enough vegan food to last me a while, I am really craving some pepperoni pizza or meatlover's or anything that isn't completely plant-based. I know I don't have much of a sob story, but I would greatly appreciate it if someone could send a pizza or two my way. And once I start my job I'll have enough extra money to offer others on here in need or in desire of a pizza from time to time.

{Oxford, UK} Just a student swamped with work and need a pick-me-up.
Hey guys, I'm verging on meltdown with two 2000 word assignments to finish before Friday. I've been trying to keep focused but I can't stop thinking about a delicious cheesy pizza. If you chose to make my day I'll even promise to give my housemate a slice.

Atlanta, GA - waiting for campus kitchen to open back up on Friday - out of food
I know you guys probably get this a lot, but the campus kitchen opens back up on Friday and I could use a pizza. I'm all out of food here and have $3 in the checking account. Would appreciate anything.

Scraping by and would like some pizza
I unfortunately didn't get a response last time I posted a few days ago but the situation hasn't changed. My fiancee and I don't have any money for groceries or anything and we have just barely managed to feed ourselves. We would love it if we could actually have a meal together that isn't ramen or baloney sandwiches (we ran out of bread anyway). If anyone could get us like a Papa John's gift card then we would definitely pay it forward at the end of this week.

Hungry kid rushing for finals.
Oooo, a person! Oh wait, nevermind. It's a computer screen. Hiii!

It has been days since I last had food. I'm broke, and hav- just kidding (Well... I'm actually broke). I'm just hungry and want some food while I study. Pizza would be amazing. Hawaiian at that. Anyway, if you give me pizza, I'll send you a virtual kiss. &lt;3

[53706] Finals are killing me and I'm trying to save a bit of money this week to take my GF out for our anniversary.
Title pretty much says it all. Stuck at the library/union cramming for finals, no food at home, and trying not to eat out very much this week to save some money to take my GF of 5 years now out to dinner this weekend. Not dire, but it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Poor, hungry, and can't cook because of a broken sink
Location: SoCal

So, money is extremely tight right now. Basically the only food I have in the house right now is ramen, but I can't cook it because the sink disposal is broken. It's been broken for a week, so we've already used up all of the dishes. Everything is dirty and the sink is flooded so we can't rinse anything let alone use the dishwasher. Not to mention the kitchen and the entire house smells like rotten food.
Anyways, pizza would be a miracle right about now. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could pull through right now. Thank you!

College guy in the midst of finals prep.
I've been studying for five hours, I am taking a break to watch some Game of Thrones. I'm an archaeology/biology double major, wanting to go on and get a PhD. I just really like pizza and I'm on a poor college kid budget. I am writing a book in my free time and would include your name in it if you would like as repayment for pizza!

No sob story here, just a guy wanting a pizza after a long day of work. (Mississauga, Ontario)
Hey sexy people, wouldn't mind a pizza coming this way :O &lt;--- 

I'm a bit tired from a long day of work and don't feel like cooking anything. The pizza will be consumed with a nicely rolled joint, a soda de la creme, shitload of hot sauce, and a nice viewing session of this weeks episode of The Flash.  If I do end up receiving a pizza, there will be pictures of me consuming it.

Will also pizza forward when I end up getting a paycheck at the middle of May. Hell, even if I don't get pizza'd ill probably get a pizza for someone so make sure to post requests!

Very hungry - willing to lend out $50 to a Kiva member in need for $25 in Domino's
Hey guys. Several months ago I gave this a shot, and it worked out really well. I got pizza and someone on Kiva got $50. I tried it again two months after, and another generous Redditor contributed for me to lend out another $50. Much thanks to /u/PizzusChrist and the other user (who has since deleted their username). If you don't know what Kiva is, check it out. Here's a link to my lender profile: http://www.kiva.org/lender/css (I added a section saying hi to Reddit as verification) I've lent a bit over $1200 on Kiva so far. Here's a screenshot of my portfolio: http://puu.sh/eTv1R/a6a2c09604.png I'm down to lend double the amount that anyone is willing to put my way in the form of a Domino's gift card. I've got a little over $50 in my Kiva account, so an amount of $25 or below would be ideal (but I'm not complaining if you offer more). You can pick who I'll lend to: http://www.kiva.org/lend - I'll reply back with proof of the loan, and you'll see them appear in my user profile. I'll post it all here so everything is legit. Thanks to anyone who gives this consideration.

I promised pizza to my brother yesterday, but I couldn't... help! (There is a catch, though).
I sent a message to my brother yesterday and I told him that I wanted pizza. He told me that he also wanted some pizza so I told him that I would go to his house after work. But I couldn't go (I had to take my pregnant wife to get the TB vaccine).

I told my brother that I would go to his house this Friday once my work pays me. But I would like to surprise him with a pizza today!

There is a catch, though... I'm in México, in a city called Nuevo Laredo (don't Google my city... No Safe for Life!). But we have Dominos, Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, etc... (I think only Dominos has online orders for my city).

So, if you would like to share a pizza with a mexican Redditor, I'm here.

Thanks.
Regards.

PS. Sorry for my English!

Please could someone buy me a pizza? I'll forward once more once I get my money through.
Hey. I'm from the UK. I'm still written off work sick, but unfortunately there has been a bit of a delay processing my documents so I am without money till next week. Probably looking at Monday - Wednesday. I do have some brown rice left over, all be it no proteins or vegetables to go with it, so I'm not going to starve completely failing the generosity of someone. I'm generally quite happy with how things are right now so if there is someone else in more need of a pick me up, please through it their way. Thanks! Simon.

First unemployment check doesn't kick in until Tuesday. Broke with no food until then.
Hey, guys; here's the story. I lost my job a couple of weeks ago due to the company I worked for being bought out, which made my job almost immediately redundant. Not long after, what meager money I was able to save was pretty much used up. So, I filed for unemployement while my job search continues. Unfortunately, I ran out of money last week and haven't eaten since. My benefits will not kick in until Monday at the earliest. Basically just trying to get a stop-gap until then. I hate asking for this because there are many others in far more dire situations that are not as easily resolved as mine, but I'm out of options. Will pay it forward IMMEDIATELY after my benefits payout comes through. I'm in Chicago, if that helps.

Moving soon
Simply put, my girlfriend and I are going to be moving off campus into a place in town for over the summer.  We will have a few friends and family helping us out and we'd love to get them some beer and pizza for the trouble. Counting my and my gf, we are expecting about seven people.  Money is going to be a bit tight for a bit as we have another roommate who will be moving in during August, but we will have to pay full rent until then.  The move is happening in two days and we are located in Muncie, Indiana.

best friend is hours away, finally clean and sober, and in need
I really hope this works...i don't have money to buy my best friend Tasha a pizza. She's found shelter for the night by a kind woman who gave Tasha her hotel room. She moved a few hours away with her boyfriend after battling a severe and inherited Meth addiction to get clean and help get her boyfriends son back. She's finally clean and currently looking for work and she's hungry and it kills me that i can't help her! Would anyone be willing to send her a pizza?

having a bad week, short on funds, and no car...
Moved back from Japan to the states back in late January (literally one of the last days of the month), got a job about a month ago but I'm still having a rough start here in the states starting over from pretty much nothing. I'm not too picky with pizza. I like sausage, and I'm totally cool with any veggie toppings, and am totally cool with just a plain cheese pizza, too. Not that it really matters in regards to pizza, but I have a soy allergy. This pizza would not only help me tonight but would also help for tomorrow as well. (I'm in Minnesota) Thanks for taking the time to look. I'd certainly pay it forward once I'm in a position to do so.

Financial Aid has failed me ):
Hola Reddit, 

 I'm sitting here on reddit after taking a small break from job hunting for odd jobs in my area. I was informed today that after waiting for my financial aid check for 2 weeks that they're unsure when I get it because I should have by now. I have no clue when I will be getting it but I'm trying to make it but it's hard with nothing to eat in the house. I just started a new job but as all new jobs, they take a while to actually give you money. 

I am just taking this one day at a time until I figure this out, but I am asking now if some redditor would be willing to help me out with something to eat. I've posted before and rec'd love and I have given after but I guess that person never decided to message the mods? (Can provide the messages from my side if the mods would like to see) It'll be just like last time, As soon as I get a check I will give another hungry redditor a hot meal. 

There is a Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, and Hungry Howies near me.

Hungry in VA
Little backstory: I'm buried in debt that mostly isn't my own; leftovers from a 6 year relationship. I've been struggling to pay rent and bills and basically surviving on cheap food and freebies people leave in the office breakroom (cookies, chips, etc).

Good news is I finally was able to pay my rent and bills within a week of them being due. Bad news is it literally broke me. I've been paying rent in installments and my landlord has been growing sick of it; informing me that I would have to move out if it continued.

So now that nothing is due, it feels great, but I'm looking through my cabinets and I have... saltine crackers, some milk, some crushed almonds, and a lot of sadness. 

More good news is I have an interview with a big company for a much better job on Monday. If I get this job it'll go a long way to fixing my problems. However, this doesn't help me now but if it does come through I'd gladly pay forward whatever help I get here. 

TL;DR paid bills/rent on time for the first time in forever but broke afterwards with no food. 

A pizza would make my day, week, month, year.

I want to have a pizza party for my students.
I want to treat a huge group of disadvantaged 9th graders to pizza. It's at most 100 kids, and I can't afford to do this on my own. Can reddit help me out on May 20th by ordering a bunch of pizzas from a nearby Little Caesars. I can swing a few $5 pizzas myself. But I need around 25 for a successful pizza party. Maybe you could send some little casears gift cards. This would mean the world to me, and it would certainly show the kids how to be generous, cool, and have fun at the same time!

More info: I teach Positive Youth Development at a high school in an impoverished area. I'm leaving to go back to school and I want to do one last thing for my kids. Thanks for reading!

Any help to make it til monday would be awesome, I will definitely pay it forward. Thanks everyone for this subreddit. ^.^

Week Three of no Grocery Run
So this week things came out pretty bad. Last week we had to decide between what utilities to pay based on who was likely to shut us off. I'm not going to be able to keep in as close contact with some folks for the foreseeable future as I won't be able to afford minutes for my phone for who knows how long. We're about a month behind on rent, could not afford to go to the grocery store and all of this comes down to a massive car problem that managed to go unfixed four hundred dollars later. (Because we had to blow that four hundred... borrowed from family... to fix a more immediate car problem.) This week we've had to play the same Who Gets Money game. It's getting iffier. The last two weeks were the week of canned veggies, too so we're basically running on E. We can probably stretch through the week but the fact of the matter is that next week won't be any better and our supplies will be more or less finished off by Friday. Payday is two weeks away. We're just two guys (father and college student son) that are in a hole we see no way to dig out of for the foreseeable future and a little bit of pizza can go a long way. We're not the worst off or the most desperate, so if you see this but also see another post where someone needs food to feed their kid or something of the sort I would actually ask you to help them instead. I know that this won't make or break us. It would just damn well contribute to a morale boosting and anything we can do to stretch out the cans in the emptying cupboard is appreciated. I can't offer much. A photo of the pie when we get it home (there's only one place nearby that will deliver and that's during a small window, so we'll probably drive into town to pick it up) and the intent to pay it forward whenever we get out of this hole are about the only two things that I've got in my bag of plays here. We're pretty well hungry.

Broke student, 4 days away from exams, losing the will to live.
Hi guys, I'd like to request a pizza. I'm a student in England, in the middle of exam period and I have very little food left for this weekend and a grand total of £17 to my name for the next month... I'm slowly losing the will to live. Please help a guy out and send me over even the smallest of pizzas to lift me out of the student-slump? Cheers!

watching someone's house for the weekend. Im not being paid, so a pizza would make my weekend. (US)
I'm spending the weekend watching my mom' best friend's husband's cat and dog. I used to get paid $75 a weekend but my mother (I'm only 19, just barely moved out) told him not to pay me anymore. There's not a lot of food in this house, so I'd really love a pizza, but I'm trying to save money to move out with my girlfriend and go to college so I can't really splurge on pizza.

Mother's day surprise
I'm making pancakes tomorrow for my wife with our two daughters, and I'm going to pick up some flowers.  That's about my whole budget for the day, though, and I'd love to surprise my wife with pizza for lunch or dinner!  Castle Rock, Colorado here.

Hungry, owed money, gas shutoff, won't get paid until late tonight after I'm done working as a soundman.
I can almost always somehow get food together, but I have exhausted all of my resources and my car stalls every block or so.  My gas is shut off in my home so I can't cook or use hot water and my microwave broke because I was using it so much to cook rice.  I tried to make rice in a coffee maker and it's not working.  My dumpster diving adventures last night proved fruitless and I could really use a pie right now!  I fear I may do a sub par job if I work on an empty stomach and all I want to do is make the bands sound good!  Send me a pizza, the bands will thank you!

Moved to Bristol recently, about to start a new job, squat is nearly sorted out. Only thing that could make this better is pizza (UK)
I've done RAOP years ago, ended up not getting the pizza for whatever reason (Oh and not sure if I had deleted the thread or not, but it was so long ago I hope you understand).

Don't have a sob story or anything, even though got no cash I know when my friend will get back from work he would feed me, but yknow, pizza is always great haha.

Also am a poet, so I can write a silly poem as a thank you haha.

Thanks in advance either way :)

We are saving all of our money, truly all of it, and are just exhausted. Any help with providing a dinner tonight would be just so helpful and a huge relief! I'm a social worker so money was tight before we had to adjust to a new budget anyways! Any kindness would be very, very appreciated!

I posted on here a few weeks ago but couldn't get in touch with anyone
As my other post said, I just got out of rehab a little over a month ago and I just started working, so right now the only thing I can afford is rent. I'm living in a sober house and everyone has been helping me out but I hate to keep asking. If anyone can help it would really really appreciate it

I've been crashing at different people's places, just got back to my childhood house, and found out it's empty. One of my best friends went back to jail after I ordered him a pizza. I don't have any food.
My parents divorced while I was up at Uni 3 hours away. I've been bumming food off of friends that were nice enough to assist with or fully pay for meals, including a Chipotle bowl that gave me diarrhea. My house is devoid of food and essentially empty, save for one bed and a stereo I brought back. All the furnishings are there, including a fridge, but yep - my childhood home is a shell of itself.

This sounds silly, but I actually did a random act of pizza for one of my friends that ended up backfiring. He came back from jail in the situation I'm basically in right now - no food in the fridge, nothing left in his apartment - and I was so happy he was out that I ordered him a honey sriracha pizza from pizza hut. However, they wouldn't deliver to him because he didn't have my debit card on his person, essentially, so he had to walk there to get it. I left him a note, spoke to the manager (who was truly sorry about "company policy" - it's paid for, just deliver the shit to him! Where's my refund?), and the pizza got to him. 

He ended up going back in two days later for breaking into an abandoned house and getting caught. I'm kicking myself for that one. 

Sorry for the sob story - I'm hungry. If someone can help a broke college kid out tonight, I'd be grateful. I'm not sure how this sub works in terms of sending addresses - I guess I PM whoever replies?

lost my wallet and keys today while moving
As title says, lost my wallet and keys last night - normally wouldn't be a problem - but I'm living off of delivery / take-out until Monday since I'm mid-move to a new house (no food in the house).

Help me out tonight, and I'll help you out Monday when I can get a new card from my bank.

21st birthday, stuck on campus for my last final for junior year, $0.67 in bank, pizza would be nice
Today is my 21st birthday (May 10th). Instead of being able to go home and celebrate with my family, however, I have to study for one more final for tomorrow, so I'm stuck on campus. I would buy a pizza myself if I had money, but I only have $0.67 usable in my account. A birthday pizza would be pretty nice right now.

I can't stand long enough to cook
I have crohn's disease and as a result have come down with a complication of erythema nodosum in my feet. Simply put, I have painful bruising and swelling in both feet and it hurts to walk and stand. I haven't eaten much in the past few days because my boyfriend has been working (and is today as well). Walking to the front door and back would likely be a lot more bearable than standing in the kitchen for 20 minutes.

Any food is appreciated.

My brothers and I have nothing to give my mother but doing chores. Pizza would be nice because we have no meat in the refrigerator or freezer and no money in pockets or bank, worst possible outcome from this time of year. My mom likes pizza(everyone does) it would be nice to have some. Thank you.

Two broke college students barely affording rent with nothing to eat!
[Here's us! ](http://i.imgur.com/w444FYb.jpg) We just moved into an apartment together because we're taking the same summer classes to try to stay ahead in our degree programs. I don't get another paycheck for a few days, and she won't get one for a week and we're both out of food with neither of us having family less than 600 miles away and my car is broken down anyways. We're in Oklahoma studying both biochem. She's also studying microbiology while I'm studying plant biology. Anyone feeling like buying us pizza? There are dominos, papa johns, and pizza hut all near us. I could probably identify any plant of yours for pizza!

I'm right next to a dominos right now so I only really need like $11 and I can do carryout. This is my last resort.

Three broke girls could use some food
My two friends and I have found ourselves in a pretty shitty situation.

One of my friends just got out of the hospital after having a seizure, the other was just fired today, and I just got dumped. It's a pretty literal pity party here, and we could use some pizza to cheer us up a bit. 

I'd love to pay it forward once my scholarship money comes through, but unfortunately my school doesn't distribute until the third week of the semester (June). Help us out now, and we'll totally make it up to you later!

Just like the title says, we don't have a sob story or any legit reason that we need pizza. We are actually doing very well for ourselves at such a young age! I just got a raise and it's my wife's birthday! It'd be cool to celebrate with some greasy goodness. If not that's cool too, I'm sure there are some people on here that REALLY need some food, at least more than us anyway. Thanks for being an awesome subreddit!

Down in the dumps, giving up seems nice.
Hey everyone, Central Florida guy here. 

It's been a bad few months, My uncle passed away, my grandfather passed away, my mom was recently diagnosed with aggressive cancer, my dad's basically drinking himself to death, and my grandma was admitted to hospice last night.

I gave up a good portion of my income to help them the best I could but that coupled with bills this last week has left me with 1.12 in my savings. 


I could really use a pizza, and there's a shop within walking distance if anyone decides im worthy. 

Thanks to everyone for reading :) 
edit: I'll make you a mixtape, draw you a pretty picture, or even give you a foot massage if that's your thing lol.

ON. Help me pay for a pizza, all I have is paypal (Immediate payback/payitforward)
Came here a while back seeking help for free pizza, but someone from r/Toronto was kind enough to give me a few bucks. Not starting my new job in toronto until wednesday afternoon so I have no cash (5$ change to get me downtown to work), but now I have 25 dollars on paypal. Looked at paypizzapal but they would charge more than 25 dollars on a 25 dollar giftcard.

If someone would be nice enough to pay for my dominoes order, and I'll immediately pay you back through paypal. I'm seriously hungry and have been living off little packages of soup for the last three days. Can 100% verify everything, including money in my paypal.
Thank you in advance to someone who can help me out

Husband promised he would cook dinner but he won't be getting home for hours and the kid is getting hungry. I've been too sick/sore to clean the house or cook the past two days and if he doesn't get home in the next two hours in going to have to tough it out and it will be pb and j for dinner again. Been holding the small one over with snacks so far but I'm sure a pizza would be much appreciated. We are in the Washington area (NOT dc!).

Hungry and Broke
My bank account is currently overdrawn about $150 and I kid you not, over $100 of that is from bank fees alone. Being poor is expensive. I have no money for food for the rest of the week, and I'm not sure what I'm going to do until Friday, but it's totally possible I could stretch one pizza that long. Would YOU, kind Redditors, be the ones to gift me that pizza?

2 days until payday, I have 3 carrots in my fridge. Pizza would really help.
We live pay check to pay check right now and have 3 kids. (Only 2 eat real food right now though. One of them is still exclusively breastfed) we had 4 unexpected expenses come up and now we have $2.50 and 3 carrots to our name until Friday and our local food bank is onky open on Mondays and Fridays. Which I didn't find out until today. We could make pizza last for dinner tonight and lunch and dinner tomorrow. Sorry for the sob story, just trying to get food for my kids.

I'll send you some free chotskies from my job if you send a pizza my way (U.S.)
I've got an afternoon of meetings headed my way including a "lunch and learn. These things are so monotonous. A pizza would be a wonderfully tasty way to slog through it. In exchange, I'll send you some of the items we use for marketing at my company. I'm not going to state the name here and I'd appreciate you likewise not doing it once I send them to you.  But I am the gatekeeper of all things awesome and I'm happy to send you a goody box as a thank you. I promise it's not just pens and notepads.

finished my last final exam and would love a pepperoni pizza to celebrate with!
The title says it all! This semester has been so tough. I had *three* freaking labs, so I had 5 finals plus 3 practical (lab) finals and it's over! It's FINALLY OVER!!

Thanks for reading :) hope someone can help me out, but even if you can't, come in here and celebrate the end of a nightmare semester!

Seems like everyone brought lunch today. I'm new to my job so no allies here.

Will Rap For Pizza
Request for 5/13 or whenever really. Glad we got people like you in this world, we need more of you and less scrooges.

I just recently got out of college and am broke, currently looking for a job. All i eat is ramen and hotdogs, or mix them both if im feeling like a culinary chef that day. A pizza would go a long way for me, I wouldnt even need anything fancy like a gyro pizza or something, a cheese pizza is generous enough. Also, I am not very talented at much or wealthy at all, but I can definitely rap. Give me a pizza and a subject and I will make a song for you. Please support your local artists, a poor college student/rapper could use all of your support. Even if a pizza is not involved I appreciate everything you guys can do.

Btw: In Illinois.

My feet hurt too much to stand
I have a medical condition called erythema nodosum in my feet-- it's a complication of having crohn's disease. Simply put, it means there is painful swelling and bruising in my feet and I can't stand or walk well.

My boyfriend is home today and has been waiting on me hand and foot since my feet became uselesss. I'd love to surprise him with a thank you pizza, but I don't get paid until saturday. I will try my best to pay this forward when I can.

Low on funds, will play Hearthstone for Pizza.
Hey guys. Walked into my office the other day and found out that I no longer have a job! Which sucks. I'm trying not to let it get me down, and am already trying to get back into the workforce ASAP. The problem is that the bank account is awful thin until Friday. So I'd appreciate any help I can get in here. You can bet your sweet ass that I'll be paying it forward the moment I get that new job.

Now, I hate a sob story as much as the next guy, so I'm willing to at least work for it. I've gotten halfway decent at Hearthstone, and am willing to play for it. You'll probably win, though!

Broke &amp; leaking from orifices [Fraser Valley, Canada]
My boyfriend and I are broke until payday with very little food to last us in the house. He's got today off, and I've been sitting here sneezing and leaking from every orifice of my body because of this could I have. Could someone help us out with a pizza? PM me if you need any special info, we'd really appreciate it. Located in Canada.

Down in the dumps. Could use a pizza pick me up!
So the last few days have been rough... money's been tight around here and there's not much food in the house, with another week before either I or my wife get paid. Yesterday I got a flat tire because there is something wrong with the front end of my car, whose inspection is past due. I am sure the repairs are going to be very expensive. Took a mental health day from work today because it's just all getting to be too much... and woke up with some pretty intense back pain.     

Some pizza would really be nice right now.   

I am located in Eastern Suffolk County in New York.

I think we've all been there - Finals week
I'll keep it short:

I leave college for the summer Saturday. 
My meal plan is nearly depleted (~8 dollars left). 
All dining halls will be closed by Friday.


tldr; I can survive without this pizza but it would definitely help hold me over until I leave.
Reddit says to include my general location but I think my username gives that away.

Graduating College, Broken out in Stress Hives and in need of a pick me up
 Okay, I'm about about to graduate college, I've been covered in stress hives for 6 weeks, which has affected my sleeping, and today, to top it off, my driver's license was stolen, and my credit card was compromised. So, I might not be able to go on my trip to Canada, to the Stratford festival.  I'm stuck in my building because I'm an on-duty RA, and I would just kill to eat something that isn't from my caf, the pizzas are straight up tombstone.  

Chicago, IL 
I would sing you a musical theatre song of your choice for a pizza

Baltimore -- Finals Week Blues
My girlfriend and I don't get paid until Friday. It's finals week and we literally have nothing to eat in the house except for dog food and two week old leftovers. I just had a final that I'm pretty sure I bombed because I'm so stressed out. Haven't eaten all day... will give back after we get paid. Thanks, guys.

Was the victim of a hit and run the other day, went to the doc to make sure my road rash is healing right. Hurting like hell and would love a pizza.
I have verification in form of photos of my road rash, which I can send along with paperwork from my doctor visit this evening matched with my ID. I don't care about pizza size. I have a Pizza Hut that is two minutes from my house I could pick up from. I just hurt too much to stay up and make myself dinner. Thanks in advance.

I'd like a pizza. No food in the fridge.
Unfortunately I don't have much money tonight, (I think less than $1 in change) and I would really like a pizza since the fridge is nearing empty (and a wish sandwich doesn't sound too great) . All I want is a small pepperoni. Or a medium if you want my girlfriend to love you when she gets home. I won't give you a sob story, or some crazy situation, just a guy and a lack of pizza. I suppose I could eat pretzels, but... Who really wants to eat pretzels for dinner? 

Oh yeah and the SO has the car. So delivery would be easiest.


Thanks!

Stuck at home while stepdad in hospital.
Really simply put my stepdad was hospitalized this morning and is still there, leaving me stranded at home with a bare pantry and really shaken nerves. I would very much appreciate anything that could be given. We live sort of out of the way and the only place that delivers is Pizza Hut. I more than understand if no one can help, I just thought it might make sense to ask.

Thank you for reading.

Please help me out I'm really hungry
Hey guys, I really could go for a warm pizza, it's cold, I'm hungry there is barely anything in the house left, I'm upset and overwhelmed.
Boyfriend and I have had some bickering going on, family being arseholes and I'm just really feeling it and it's getting to me. I had a breakdown earlier and just feel awful. I'm home alone so today would be a perfect time to get pizza, otherwise I could always wait I guess but yeah, I'm really hungry and haven't anything/don't have anything to make for dinner. I've just had a big build up of stress and I'm really over it.


Thanks for the assistance/reading, it really does mean a lot to me. x

Need something to feed the Kids tonight.
I really could use a pizza for dinner tonight, (family of 5)  opened the fridge, have 1 egg, can of greenbeans, 2 pieces of bread, and 1 pepper.  Can't make anything out of that for everyone.  Tomorrow is payday so I just have to make it thru today.

I have pizza hut and dominos in my area.  I am happy with either one.  
I hate to beg, but I really need just a little help for tonight.
Thank You!

Poor boyfriend trying to help his girlfriend
Hey guys, so I'm a recent college graduate and for my last semester I was so overwhelmed with school I couldn't work. I have been scraping by fine alone. I have a girlfriend and we dated through the last year of my studies. My girlfriend was from back home and not from where I was going to school but she would visit when she could, I now live with her. On her birthday she even drove to see me and made sure I was fed and taken care of. She has a son a brought him too and it was wonderful. I haven't been able to do much for her. She has ordered a few pizzas for me over the semester and I unfortunately have never been able to return the favor and would really love to. I missed out babying her on her birthday and on Mother's Day. More than anything this is less about free pizza and more about giving a wonderful woman something nice in return for being so awesome to me. I start working next week but right now she is between paydays and she is really really hurting and I would absolutely love if someone could help me out. I am more than willing to return the favor starting next week, I'm a server at a restaurant and with my first tips I'll get you a pie of your choosing. Please and thank you! :)

Pizza, please?
Basically, my spouse lost his job and we've been forced to live off of my low income and our savings for a couple of months. 

He finally got a new job (yay!), but we've also run out of savings and it will be two weeks until he starts bringing in money. 

Pizza would help us out more than I care to admit, but we would be forever grateful and will absolutely pay it forward in due time. 

I'd love for someone to help us out within the next few days!

any food at all
First time trying this. So yeah. I live in Pennsylvania. (Specifics upon request). I work with mentally handicapped individuals as a full time job. Sadly, I can't give the address of the place i'm working at, but I can give the neighbors address. By no means am I starving, just hungry and cant take the individual I work with anywhere (highly violent). Just seeing if any lind samaritan can send me some food. I'm in no need though, so if you see people that need the food, then send it to them. I'm here until 3 est today, but i'm sure the guy coming to the house to work after me would enjoy it if youcant get it in by then. Thanks for looking guys!

[USA-NC] Almost a month since the crash and still not able to go back to work.
Or anywhere really, since the car was totaled and I'm not allowed to drive. I would love to give my fiance a treat and order some Dominos as thanks for all the help he's been since I've had this cast on my leg, but not being able to work has been a massive hit to the budget. If you help me do something nice for him, I'll pay it forward once I'm back on my feet, both literally and figuratively.

Pizza to feed family
My dad is out of town for today and I thought I had money to buy me and my little brother food but it turns out the money was spent earlier by my dad. Me and him are stuck here for the next 16 hours or so without anything to eat so I was wondering if we could get some help here. Thank you for your time, and God bless.

Broke med student, revising for exams and would love a pizza!
Totally broke and been living off mostly toast for a while. Would love if anyone was kind enough to send me a pizza (is it bad that I spent at least 10 minutes considering what pizza I'll get while typing the word pizza? Positively drooling now!) as a little pick me up while I'm stuck inside revising? Will pass it along after finals when I start working again!

Unfortunately I have no money or food for a little while, please could you help? Information inside.
Hello. Firstly I would like to say I will once again forward once I get my money through. I'm currently off work due to long term disability after an almost hit and run which caused me to break my leg. To get my ESA (Employment and support allowance), I have to forward my medical documents from my GP to the government. It's a long, pointless process. Anyway, the documents got lost in the sorting office, so I've had to request duplicate documents from my Doctor. The only problem being that it has to be the original Doctor that saw me over two weeks ago. Only today was he in the Doctors surgery and managed to complete the notes. I will pick them up tomorrow. I'm looking at getting money next week, *hopefully*. I've not eaten any food at all in days. I was running on brown rice for a short while. I posted in /r/assistance and some kind soul has sent me a Tesco's giftcard so I can buy food but it won't arrive till Saturday. If anyone could help me out I would be grateful. Thanks. Also I would be happy to send over proof if need be.

In Between Jobs
First time posting on this subreddit. I've heard a lot of positive things about it and figured I'd give it a shot. 

Right now I'm in between jobs. I'm waiting on some paper work to go through (it's been 12 days since I've taken a drug test and the lab still has not contacted my new employer about my results). Anyways, I'm at my girlfriends house and she's been nothing but amazing since I left my other job and has been supportive while I was finding a new on. She has also payed for some of my meals when we go out with friends. I just want to show my gratitude with a pizza for her. In return, once I finally start this new job, I will promise to repay my debt to more hungry redditors!

Thanks Random_Acts_of_Pizza!

Could use a pizza in Dublin, OH
I just moved to Dublin Ohio for an Internship. This is my first time living alone, and I'm about 200 miles from home. I also forgot some important things, and had to buy them again here (razors, shaving cream, nail clippers, etc.) I underestimated how much living and commuting to work costs, and now I've got just enough money for gas this next week. A pizza would be great tonight, and I'll gladly pay it forward when I get paid next week.

Went in for surgery, husband and friends deserve pizza for how supportive/amazing they are!
I found out a few days ago that I needed to get my gallbladder removed. I've never had surgery before so I was scared outta my mind and in the hospital for the past two days, three nights. My husband (who's birthday also happened to be the day I went in for the surgery) was there the entire time waiting on me hand and foot. And one friend came up after just getting released from the hospital herself with a cyst removed. My other friend brought up his Wii U and basically let us play whatever, as well as kept me laughing (even if it hurt!) so I wasn't as freaked out about it. I just think after all they've done for me they deserve gold medals. But I think for three twenty-year-old college kids pizza will be enough! We're going to be throwing a little late birthday hang out party for my husband Friday, tomorrow for me, and both of those friends will be there, so that'd be the best time to have a surprise pizza delivery. 

I can offer proof of my surgery via discharge papers and pictures of my surgery new cuts. We live in Oklahoma City, OK and the closest pizza place to us is Dominoes!

College Senior starving on Grad day! I'd eat my degree if I could!!!
Hello all! This is the graduation weekend of my university and, unfortunately, I'm not able to revel in it quite the way I'd like to. I'm a college senior but I've yet to find a job within my field and my temporary campus job was JUST enough for me to cover rent and bills this month before it ended. Normally, I'd spend this time among family and friends celebrating but finances and job obligations have unfortunately prevented my loved ones from being with me at this time. (I live out of state) I would sincerely appreciate a pizza to hold me over a few days, as I collect myself and reflect over both this moment and my next moves.
I'm in the North Texas area
At the moment, I'm on my way to donate plasma for grocery money to get me through next week but I will check my account periodically.
Thanks for the goodwill, guys!

My husband and I both have finally finished the semester, it was my first and his second, I know that I made the dean's list and he has yet to get all of his grades posted but chances are he did as well, so we'd love to celebrate with some pizza instead of cereal, ramen or sandwiches this time.

Husband and wife, escaped domestic violence situation that ended up with injuries and charges, hiding in hotel, no food. Please help..
Hey guys,
Me and my wife recently escaped a domestic violence situation that ended up with someone getting hurt... We can't go much further into details as there are charged laid against me for some reason, even though I spent a night tied down in a hospital with a broken toe (door that I was using as a shield fell on me) , suffice it to say once this is all over were going to sue the pants off our local police station, but for now we need to lawyer up.
We're currently safe hiding in a motel room paid for by a local woman's shelter, but have no food to eat. There's a mini-fridge and a microwave but we've spent every last dollar we had to retain a crazy aggressive criminal lawyer so can't afford tv dinners... We don't even have a can opener or bowls or plates or anything.
We were hoping someone could help us out with a pie or two that we could ration until we have some money come in next week. We live in Ontario, Canada, 1-4 hours from Detroit.

College Student who's broke and hungry.
The semester is over so I don't have a meal plan. I start my new job on Monday so a nice pie I can stretch across two days.  thanks for reading.

England] I'd love some hot food if someone is feeling generous please.
Only have cereal in the house and all my money was swallowed by an eBay scammer. If anyone is feeling generous I'd love to eat something more than just Rice Krispies for the next few days please.

My ad agency was just absorbed by idiots, and I just gave my car to some young idiot.
Advertising is based on one thing, happiness. And you know what happiness is? Happiness is the smell of a new car. It's freedom from fear. It's a billboard on the side of the road that screams reassurance that whatever you are doing is okay. You are okay. It's also pizza. I could really use a pizza.

I made a series of bad decisions and now am incapable of doing anything but holding my head and groaning in bed.

Transition between jobs leaving me hungry and broke [Indianapolis]
I just started a new job Tuesday, after being without a job for a week and a half. I'm not going to get paid anything until Friday, and my (admittedly small) emergency fund pool has just about run out. I'd love it if a cheese pizza were to show up at my door right about now. I'll pass it along as soon as I'm back on my feet.

Also, I've never had the Papa John's code "25off" fail in my area, if that helps.

Gave the last of our money to our daughter to go on a trip with her cousins, me and the wife could use something other canned soup for dinner, pizza us?
Title pretty much says it all, we're broke and we gave the last the of our money so she could go on a trip with her grandmother and nieces. We're looking forward to canned soup for dinner unless someone can hook us up with a pizza. 

Thanks

College student- Hungry, broke, and tired of Cheez-its and Ramen.
I get paid in a couple weeks, would be planning to pay it forward once I get paid again. If I eat another cheez-it I might cry. Located in Poughkeepsie, NY-- we have pretty much all the major pizza chains! :)

Left abusive job a week ago, have been surviving on scraps since then.
I'm booked for a new job that starts next week, and I'm getting paid a week after that, but until then, it's scraps. I live in South Florida. Much love for you guys, and thanks.

Girlfriend finishes her 4 year Masters degree today, and I'm too broke to take her out!
If anyone could help me treat her with a pizza, it would be much appreciated.
