4/18 - Sqlite3 db syntax: for string, use ? instead of python string format.
4/19 - Request reddit server using normal syntax. After 1000 stories, no new stories returned. Solution: use search in request.
4/20 - Test request reddit server using search with timestamp. Timestamps of returned stories don't agree with the timestamp specified in the request. Solution: give a fixed long time period, use after to separate.
4/21 - Update comments.
4/25 - Given a long period of time, retrieve stories using search timestamp and after. However, for the same request, only 1000 stories returned. Need to update timestamp if the limit is reached.
4/26 - retrieve info from db
4/27 - parse story to find label
